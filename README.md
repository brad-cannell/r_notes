# R Notes

This repository is for a [Bookdown](https://bookdown.org/) version Brad Cannell's R Notes. I'm really making this repository for me, but even better if you find it useful too!

Why am I doing this (as opposed to just keeping notes locally)?       
* Better organized (e.g., chapter structure and search)      
* Easy access -- just click on the bookmark on web browser      
* Practice using bookdown      
* Might help with R4Epi -- This can be sort of a sandbox for developing before I add things to R4Epi.
