# Packages: Quick Start {#my-package-notes}

<!--
Hidden comments placeholder
-->

## ‚≠êÔ∏èOverview

This chapter is my quick start guide for creating packages. I'm going to walk through the process I used to create the `codebook` package, plus add some extra notes that have been helpful along the way when creating other packages. 

This is not meant to be a comprehensive guide to creating packages. [Hadley Wickham and Jenny Bryan's R Packages book](https://r-pkgs.org/) already exists for that purpose. This is supposed to just be a quick overview and some notes to remember in the future. 


## üåéUseful websites

* [Hadley Wickham and Jenny Bryan's R Packages book](https://r-pkgs.org/)   
* [devtools package](https://github.com/r-lib/devtools)   
* [usethis package](https://github.com/r-lib/usethis)


## Quick Process 

1. [Create new project/package directory](#create) with `usethis::create_package()`. Restart.

2. [Add a NOTES file](#notes).

3. [Add license](#license) with `usethis::use_mit_license()`.

4. [Modify the description file](#modify).

5. [Add README](#readme) with `usethis::use_readme_rmd()` and `devtools::build_readme()`.

6. [Add Git](#git) with `usethis::use_git()`. Restart.

7. [Connect to GitHub](#github) with `usethis::use_github()`.

8. [Add functions to the package](#package-functions).


## Before creating the package

Give the package a new ([Hadley's naming strategies](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/package.html))


## Step 1: Create the package project {#create}

Call `create_package()` to initialize a new package in a directory on your computer (and create the directory, if necessary).

```{r, eval=FALSE}
usethis::create_package("/Users/bradcannell/Dropbox/R/Packages/codebook")
```

The function will do all of this:

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/01_programming/create_package.png")
```


## Step 2: Add a NOTES file {#notes}

The [R Packages book](https://r-pkgs.org/) doesn't mention creating a `NOTES` file, but it's something I like to do. I use the notes file to help me remember little things related to the development of the package that aren't meant to be shared publicly. 

1. Create a new text file, add the following template to the top of the file, and fill it out appropriately. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
# =============================================================================
# codebook notes
# =============================================================================

Use NOTES for notes, but not tasks. Why or how, but not what.

Submission Notes:
-----------------
* Useful website: http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/release.html
* Update README before submission. It should roughly match the examples in the roxygen documentation.
  - Update README.Rmd, not README.md.
  - Knit README.Rmd after making changes. This will automatically update README.md
* Update vignettes using devtools::document()
* Update news.md. Here's dplyr's (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tidyverse/dplyr/master/NEWS.md)
* If you were on a development branch, merge with main branch.
* Use devtools::check()
* Use devtools::check_win_devel() to test the package on Windows
* Update cran-comments.
  - If this is a resubmission, add a bulleted list of changes made under ## Resubmission.
* Submit with devtools::release()
* After the package is accepted, do this stuff: http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/release.html#post-release
```

2. Save as `NOTES`

3. Add to gitignore.

```{r eval=FALSE}
usethis::use_git_ignore("NOTES")
```

4. Add to buildignore. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
usethis::use_build_ignore("NOTES")
```


## Step 3: Add license {#license} 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
usethis::use_mit_license()
```

The function will do all of this:

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/01_programming/use_mit_license.png")
```

You will still need to open the new `LICENSE` file and change `COPYRIGHT HOLDER:` to "Brad Cannell". You can also look in the templates folder for more elaborate licenses. 


## Step 4: Modify the description file {#modify}

Open the description file and make some changes. 

Here is a minimal example from `codebook`:

```{r eval=FALSE}
Package: codebook
Title: Create Codebooks From Data Frames
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R: person("Brad", "Cannell", email = "brad.cannell@gmail.com",
  role = c("aut", "cre", "cph"))
Maintainer: Brad Cannell <brad.cannell@gmail.com>
Description: The codebook package is intended to make it easy for users to 
  create codebooks (i.e. data dictionaries) directly from data frame.
License: MIT + file LICENSE
Encoding: UTF-8
Roxygen: list(markdown = TRUE)
RoxygenNote: 7.1.2
```

Here is a slightly more elaborate example from `meantables`:

```{r eval=FALSE}
Package: meantables
Type: Package
Title: Make Quick Descriptive Tables for Continuous Variables
Description: Quickly make tables of descriptive statistics (i.e., counts, 
    means, confidence intervals) for continuous variables. This 
    package is designed to work in a Tidyverse pipeline, and consideration
    has been given to get results from R to 'Microsoft Word' ¬Æ with minimal pain.
Version: 0.1.2
Authors@R: person("Brad", "Cannell", email = "brad.cannell@gmail.com",
  role = c("aut", "cre", "cph"))
Maintainer: Brad Cannell <brad.cannell@gmail.com>
License: MIT + file LICENSE
Encoding: UTF-8
Suggests: 
    knitr,
    rmarkdown,
    testthat
VignetteBuilder: knitr
RoxygenNote: 7.1.2
Imports: 
    dplyr,
    tibble,
    rlang,
    stringr
```

* Remember that Title Case is required for the Title

* **Do Not** use `library(package)` in R scripts - instead add package dependencies to the `Imports` or `Remotes` field in the DESCRIPTION. **Do** use `library(package)` in vignette .Rmd files, and **DO NOT** add these package dependencies to the DESCRIPTION

* If we already added R scripts to the package directory, we need to open them now and make sure to remove all the `library()` functions. 

* When adding CRAN packages to imports, you must first make sure they are installed.

* <a href = "https://github.com/hadley/devtools/blob/master/vignettes/dependencies.Rmd" target = "_blank">Instructions for installing dependencies from sources other than CRAN are given here</a>.


## Step 5: Add README {#readme}

In [R Packages, Chapter 2: The Whole Game](https://r-pkgs.org/whole-game.html), Hadley and Jenny basically create all the package code before connecting their project to their remote repository on GitHub. I actually like to connect my project to GitHub before I write any code. I do this for several reasons, one of which is that I can start using GitHub's issues and project boards right away to take notes and plan package development. 

And, I like to create the README file before I initialize Git or connect with GitHub. That's what we will do in this step. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
usethis::use_readme_rmd()
```

* I generally just copy the Description section from the `DESCRIPTION` file and use it replace the "The goal of codebook is to ..." sentence that that `use_readme_rmd()` creates by default. 

* Comment out all of the code chunks that `use_readme_rmd()` creates by default.

* Add installation instructions to README. Although we haven't created the repository yet, we know what it's going to be called.    

The README file already contains the following lines:

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/01_programming/install_placeholder.png")
```

We just need to replace it with:

**Make sure to set the `eval=FALSE` code chunk option.**

```{r eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("brad-cannell/codebook")
```

* Just replace "codebook" in the path above with the name of the repository for the package project you are currently working on. 

* You can leave everything else as-is for now. 

**Render README**

Don‚Äôt forget to render it to make README.md! The pre-commit hook should remind you if you try to commit README.Rmd, but not README.md, and also when README.md appears to be out-of-date.

The very best way to render README.Rmd is with build_readme(), because it takes care to render with the most current version of your package, i.e. it installs a temporary copy from the current source.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::build_readme()
```


## Step 6: Add Git {#git}

```{r, eval=FALSE}
usethis::use_git()
```

* Go ahead and commit all the files in the directory so far, and agree to restart R. 


## Step 7: Connect to GitHub {#github}

**Caution**

So far, using this method will add the repo to my personal account (mbcann01), not to my organization. You can either:

* Create the repo manually on GitHub first, then follow GitHub's instructions for syncing.

* After you create the repo on mbcann01, transfer ownership to brad-cannell in the Settings menu.  

```{r eval=FALSE}
usethis::use_github()
```

The function will do all of this:

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/01_programming/use_github.png")
```

* Go ahead and agree to commit. 


## Step 8: Add functions to the package {#package-functions}

At this point, we have an (empty) working package, which can be downloaded from our GitHub repository. Now, we just need to add the functions, data, and documentation that will make it actually worth using. 




# Left off here....





## Working with R scripts

1. Don't write or alter your functions in the console as you would in a typical interactive session. If you do, it's easy for the version you're using interactively and the version you are actually including in your package to get out of sync. Instead, _load_ the package.

2. Click the build tab > More > Load All, or `devtools::load_all`, or shift + cmd + L


## Step 3: Writing help pages

Help pages are contained in .Rd files saved in the man folder. It's best practice to use `roxygen` with your script files to automatically generate the .Rd files. Doing so helps to keep your scripts and your help pages in sync.

To use roxygen:

1. Make sure the R script you want to document is active.

2. Click Project Options > Build Tools > Generate documentation with Roxygen

3. Place your cursor in the function you want to document

4. Insert a Roxygen skeleton with the keyboard shortcut cmd + alt + shift + R

5. After you've filled in the skeleton click Build > More > Document, or use the keyboard shortcut shift + cmd + D. RStudio will then automatically generate the help pages in your man folder.

6. Click the build tab > More > Load All, or `devtools::load_all`, or shift + cmd + L

7. Check your help page by typing ?function_name in the console.

### Example `roxygen` header

```{r eval = FALSE}
#' @title Compact Table of Summary Statistics
#'
#' @description  Based on Stata's "tabstat" command. "tabstat displays summary
#'  statistics for a series of numeric variables in one table.  It allows you
#'  to specify the list of statistics to be displayed.  Statistics can be
#'  calculated (conditioned on) another variable.  tabstat allows substantial
#'  flexibility in terms of the statistics presented and the format of the
#'  table" (Stata, 2016).
#'
#' @param x A continuous variable.
#' @param digits Rounds the values returned to the specified number of decimal
#'  places (default 3).
#' @param stats Return specified statistics. Options include:
#'  \describe{
#'    \item{n}{Count of nonmissing values of x}
#'    \item{nmiss}{Count of missing values of x}
#'    \item{ci}{95 percent confidence interval for the mean of x}
#'    \item{sum}{Sum of x}
#'    \item{max}{Maximum value of x}
#'    \item{min}{Minimum value of x}
#'    \item{range}{(Maximum value of x) - (minimum value of x)}
#'    \item{sd}{Standard deviation of x}
#'    \item{var}{Variance of x}
#'    \item{cv}{Coefficient of variation (sd / mean) of x}

#'    \item{q}{Equivalent to specifying p25 p50 p75}
#'  }
#'
#' @return A data frame. By default, the data frame contains the variable name
#'  and mean.

#' "p25", "p50", "median", "p75", "p90", "p95", "p99", "iqr", "q"))
```

### Don't run the examples

If you don't want the examples to actually run, You can surround the example code with \dontrun{} like this:

```{r}
#' @examples
#' \dontrun{
#' library(dplyr)
#' library(meantables)
#'
#' data(mtcars)
#'
#' # Overall mean table with defaults
#'
#' mtcars %>%
#'   mean_table(mpg)
#'
#' # A tibble: 1 x 9
#'   response_var     n  mean    sd   sem   lcl   ucl   min   max

#' }
```


### Keyboard shortcut for inserting roxygen #' comment

There doesn't appear to be a keyboard shortcut, but this [StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33399203/keyboard-shortcut-for-inserting-roxygen-comment-start#:~:text=But%20you%20can%20add%20an,%2Balt%2Bshift%2BR%20.) shows a good method for using RStudio's find and replace.


### Documenting Package:

You can use roxygen to provide a help page for your package as a whole. <a href = "http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/man.html" target = "_blank">More information is available from Hadley here</a>.

**At this point, you have a usable package**

### Once package is complete (ish)

1. Update documentation (help pages). Build > More > Document, or shift + cmd + D.

2. Check the package by clicking Build > Check. This will look for common package problems

3. Click Build > Build & Reload. That will build the package and install it in your local package directory

4. If you want to copy the package to send to someone else, click Build > More > Build source package. RStudio will build the package and save it as a .tar.gz file. You can then send it to another user to be installed on their system.

5. If you are using GitHub, you need to commit changes and then push them to GitHub. More information about using Git and GitHub are available <a href = "http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/git.html" target = "_blank">here</a>. Other users can install your package directly from GitHub with `install.packages("devtools")` followed by `devtools::install_github("username/packagename")`.

### Notes about package notes:   

* Because packages are almost always a work in progress, you will want to add notes to yourself about the project in the source package that you don't want others to see. You can do this by creating a notes directory, and then listing that directory in `.Rbuildignore`. You can add to buildignore using `usethis::use_build_ignore("notes")`. More information is available [here](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/package.html).

* Also make sure to add NOTES to `.gitignore` with `usethis::use_git_ignore("notes")`

* Use NOTES for notes, but not tasks. Why or how, but not what. Tasks go into issues.

* There is a NOTES template in R/Templates.


## Step 4: Synchronize with GitHub

Again, details are available in <a href = "http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/git.html" target = "_blank">Hadley Wickham's Book</a>.   

Note: to exculde files from add them to `.gitignore` manually, or by clicking Git > More > Ignore.

1. If you didn't check "Create a git repository" in step 1, you'll need to create one now. Do so by clicking Project Options > Git/SVN > Version Control System.   

2. May need to restart R

3. [Create a README.md file](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/release.html#readme) (`devtools::use_readme_rmd()`)

* Note: This only works if you set up the project as a package. Do this, even if you don't intend to create a package. There are just nice extra tools avaialable when you select project type > R Package.

4. Create a new repo on GitHub: https://github.com/new. Give it the same name as your package, and include the package title as the repo description. Leave all the other options as is, then click Submit.   

5. Open a shell, then type `git remote add origin https://github.com/mbcann01/dataclean.git`   

6. Modify DESCRIPTION to add URL and BugReports fields that link to your new GitHub site.

7. Save the file and commit (with the message ‚ÄúUpdating DESCRIPTION to add links to GitHub site‚Äù)

8. Open a shell, then type `git push -u origin master`

9. Enter username `mbcann01` and password `asdf1234`

10. Go to your GitHub page and look at the DESCRIPTION

### Get rid of .DS_Store

The `.DS_Store` file can be an annoyance when working with Git on MacOS. [Here is a link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/107701/how-can-i-remove-ds-store-files-from-a-git-repository/107921) to instructions for removing `.DS_Store` from your repository. Do it early and never worry about it again. 

In the terminal, run the following code from the root directory:

```{bash eval=FALSE}
# Remove existing files from the repository:
find . -name "*.DS_Store" -type f -exec git-rm {} \;
```

```{bash eval=FALSE}
# Add .DS_Store to .gitignore
echo .DS_Store >> .gitignore
```

```{bash eval=FALSE}
# Commit the file to the repo
git add .gitignore
git commit -m '.DS_Store banished!'
```

### Example: Modify Description

```{r eval = FALSE}
URL: https://github.com/mbcann01/dataclean
BugReports: https://github.com/mbcann01/dataclean/issues
```

### Example Installation instructions for README:

All files can be viewed directly on Github. To install this package locally, simply use `devtools`:

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("mbcann01/detectPilotTest")
library(detectPilotTest)
browseVignettes("detectPilotTest")
```


## Step 5: Testing

Testing is an important part of programming. For detailed information on testing see the appropriate chapter in <a href = "http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/tests.html" target = "_blank">Hadley Wickham's Book</a>.   

Further guidance is available <a href = "https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2011-1/RJournal_2011-1_Wickham.pdf" target = "_blank">at the R Journal</a>.   

Get started with `devtools::use_testthat()`.

1. Create test file. Must be in `tests/testhat`. File name should start with test_ and the function name. For example, `test_check_catvars`.   

2. Modify your code or tests   

3. Test your package with Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + T or `devtools::test()`.   

4. Repeat until all tests pass.


## Vignettes

There are some great vignette resources on the internet: 

* <a href = "http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/vignettes.html" target = "_blank">Chapter on vignettes in Hadley's Package book</a>   

* <a href = "ftp://cran.r-project.org/pub/R/doc/contrib/Leisch-CreatingPackages.pdf" target = "_blank">Leisch's creating R packages tutorial</a>   

* <a href = "http://rmflight.github.io/posts/2014/07/vignetteAnalysis.html" target = "_blank">Flight's article on creating an analysis as a package and vignette</a>   


### To create a vignette:   

* run `usethis::use_vignette("my-vignette")`

* Open `vignettes/my-vignette.Rmd`

* Create the vignette

* Unlike R scripts, install and load packages directly in the vignettes.

* Knit the vignette - The default action will be to create a version of the vignette that can be viewed in RStudio. However, `devtools::install_github()` (and friends) will not build vignettes by default because they‚Äôre time consuming and may require additional packages. So, in order to be able to view the vignette in RStudio, you must use vignettes = TRUE, e.g., devtools::install_github("brad-cannell/bfuncs", build_vignettes = TRUE) instead.

* Use `devtools::build_vignettes()` to create an html version of the vignette in `inst/doc` that you can provide a link to on your Github README page. By default, these folders will be added to .gitignore. Remove them from .gitignore to be able to view/use them on Github. Create a rawgit version of the html vignette file, and providea link to it on README.

* use use `devtools::build()` to create a package bundle with the vignettes included. RStudio‚Äôs ‚ÄúBuild & reload‚Äù does not build vignettes to save time.

* When you add or update vignettes, push to Github again.

### Vignette Notes:

This builds the vignettes, and is probably fine for a regular package of functions. However, when using packages as a means for reproducible, self-contained analysis projects, the vignettes have greater importance, and by default are not easily accessible.   
Need to find a way to make the vignettes more "front and center"   

* Create a help page for the entire package that includes links to the vignettes?

* Include links to the README.md file and upload to GitHub (with the data sets excluded)?

* Remember to use `system.file()` when reading in data inside a code chunk. If you have trouble getting it to work, try build & reload.

* To save a data frame to `data/` inside a vignette, you can use the <a href = "https://github.com/krlmlr/rprojroot" target = "_blank">rprojroot package</a>. use `rprojroot::find_root("DESCRIPTION")`

## Adding and documenting data

The explanation in the [R Packages book](https://r-pkgs.org/data.html) is good, short, and easy to follow.

## Submitting to CRAN

Useful website: http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/release.html

1. Update README before submission. It should roughly match the examples in the roxygen documentation.
   - Update `README.Rmd`, not `README.md`.   
   - Knit `README.Rmd` after making changes. This will automatically update `README.md`   
  
2. Update vignettes using `devtools::document()`

3. Update news.md. Here's dplyr's: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tidyverse/dplyr/master/NEWS.md

4. If you were on a development branch, merge with main branch.

5. Use `devtools::check()`

6. Use `devtools::check_win_devel()` to test the package on Windows

7. Update `cran-comments`.   
 - If this is a resubmission, add a bulleted list of changes made under ## Resubmission.

8. Submit with `devtools::release()`

After the package is accepted, do this stuff: http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/release.html#post-release


## Errors, warnings, notes

Below are some common errors, warnings and notes I've encountered during build tests.

> W  checking for unstated dependencies in examples ...
   'library' or 'require' call not declared from: ‚Äòtidyverse‚Äô
E  checking examples (707ms)
   Running examples in ‚Äòfreqtables-Ex.R‚Äô failed
   The error most likely occurred in:
   
I got this error because I had `library(tidyverse)` in the @examples section of my roxygen2 header in one of my R scripts, but I did not have `tidyverse` in the Imports section of my DESCRIPTION file. I could add `tidyverse` to the DESCRIPTION file (`usethis::use_package("tidyverse", type = "Imports")`). However, in this case I chose to use `library(dplyr)`, which was already in the Imports section of my DESCRIPTION file, instead.

>
W  checking dependencies in R code (369ms)
   '::' or ':::' import not declared from: ‚Äòrlang‚Äô

To fix this one simply run the following code in the console: `usethis::use_package("rlang", type = "Imports")`

> Warning: ‚Äòinst/doc‚Äô files ... ignored as vignettes have been rebuilt.

Just ignore this one.

> Warning in strptime(xx, f <- "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%OS", tz = tz) : unknown timezone 'zone/tz/2017c.1.0/zoneinfo/America/Chicago'

Just ingnore this one. It's a problem with my computer, not with the package code.

> Non-standard files/directories found at top level: ‚Äòdevelop_test_table.Rmd‚Äô ‚Äòdevelop_test_table.nb.html‚Äô

Need to delete these files when I'm done developing chi-square test.

> Prevents R CMD check: "no visible binding for global variable ‚Äò.‚Äô"

Put the following (for example) directly inside the function definition in the R script where the function is defined:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# ------------------------------------------------------------------
# Prevents R CMD check: "no visible binding for global variable ‚Äò.‚Äô"
# ------------------------------------------------------------------
n = n_total = prop = t_crit = se = lcl_wald = ucl_wald = percent = NULL
```

> N  checking R code for possible problems (1.8s)
   get_group_n: no visible global function definition for ‚Äò%>%‚Äô
   Undefined global functions or variables:
     %>%
     
[Info on fixing this issue](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/namespace.html#imports)

Short answer: Add the following directly inside the roxygen2 header in the R script where the function is defined: `@importFrom dplyr %>%`. You must also make sure that it gets to the NAMESPACE. Run `usethis::use_namespace()` and then `devtools::document()` to get it into NAMESPACE.

> Non-standard file/directory found at top level: 'meantables_hex'
  
I got this error after submitting meantables to CRAN. The problem is with the hex sticker file in the meantable hex sticker I added for the README. This SO issue gives some advice: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44113759/note-or-warning-from-package-check-when-readme-md-includes-images

I moved the stickers to `man/figures`. It seems to have solved the problem.
