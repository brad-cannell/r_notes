**Tidy Eval** is as system for **programming**, as opposed to working interactively, with **dplyr**.

Tidy Eval is all about **quoting**. Not in the `""` sense, which is to create a character string. Rather, Quoting is the action of capturing an expression instead of evaluating it. This is similar to the way formulas work in R. For example:

```{r}
# Computing the value of the expression:
toupper(letters[1:5])
```

```{r}
# Capturing the expression:
quote(toupper(letters[1:5]))
```

**Don't forget:** When using quoted expressions, or **quotures** inside functions, you must **unquote** them where you want the expression evaluated. You can unquote with `!!` or unquote-splice with `!!!`.

You can also use the curly-curly syntax to unquote: `{{}}`. I'm still not clear on when to use one vs. the other. 


## Key Functions {#key_functions}

* `.data` pronoun 

    + Not officially part of Tidy Eval (part of rlang). 
    
    + However, useful to keep in mind in situations where you might be programming over multiple data frames. If you're in that situation, go check out the _Pragramming with dplyr_ link above for more details.

* `quo()`

    + This is sort of the foundational function in Tidy Eval. It creates a class **quoture** object, which is a special type of formula.
    
    + quo() captures expressions when outside of user-defined functions.

```{r}
# What does quo() return?
quo(species) # Where species is a variable in the Starwars tibble
```

```{r}
# Basic usage of quo() in function
freq_table <- function(df, x, ...) {
  df %>%                             # No quoting and unquoting necessary for the tibble
    group_by(!!x) %>%                # Don't forget to unquote (!!) where you want the quoture evaluated
    summarise(N = n()) %>%           # Calculate freq
    top_n(3, N)                      # Return top 3 results
}

freq_table(df = starwars, x = quo(species))
```

* `enquo()`

    + If you don't want the user of your function to be able to pass the variable name as an argument without wrapping in `quo()`, that's where `enquo()` comes in.
    
```{r}
# Basic usage of enquo() in function
freq_table <- function(df, x, ...) {
  x <- enquo(x)                      # Capturing function argument and turning it into a quoture
  df %>%                             
    group_by(!!x) %>%                
    summarise(N = n()) %>%           
    top_n(3, N)                      
}

freq_table(df = starwars, x = species) # Notice we no longer need to wrop species with quo()
```

* `quos()`

    + Use `quos()` with `...` when you want to pass multiple variables / arguments / expressions into your function.
    
    + Must unquote-splice `!!!` in your function to evaluate.
    
```{r}
# What does quos() return?
quos(species, name) # Where species and name are variables in the Starwars tibble
```

You can iterate over the list of quotures returned by `quos()`
    
```{r}
my_quos <- quos(species, name)
for(i in seq_along(my_quos)) {
  print(my_quos[[i]])
}
```

Don't forget to unquote-splice with `!!!`

```{r}
# Basic use of quos() in a for loop
my_quos <- quos(species, name)
for(i in seq_along(my_quos)) {
  summarise(starwars, n_miss = sum(is.na(!!my_quos[[i]]))) %>% print # Can use !! or !!! in this case
}
```

```{r}
# Basic usage of quos() in function
freq_table <- function(df, ...) {    # Notice we dropped the "x" argument
  x <- quos(...)                     # Capturing function argument and turning it into a quoture list
  df %>%                             
    group_by(!!!x) %>%               # Must use unquote-splice (!!!) in this case
    summarise(N = n()) %>%
    ungroup() %>% 
    slice(1:5)                      
}

freq_table(df = starwars, species, hair_color)
```

* `quo_name()`

    + Sometimes we want to convert the argument to a string for use in our function output. For example, we may want to dynamically create variable names inside the function.

```{r}
# What does quo_name return?
quo_name("height") # Input must be a string or a quoture
```

```{r}
# What does quo_name return?
height <- quo(height)
quo_name(height) # Input must be a string or a quoture
```

```{r}
# Basic usage of quos() in function
continuous_table <- function(df, x) {
  x2 <- enquo(x)                             # Must enquo first
  mean_name <- paste0("mean_", quo_name(x2))
  sum_name  <- paste0("sum_", quo_name(x2))
  
  df %>% 
    summarise(
      !!mean_name := mean(!!x2, na.rm = TRUE), # Must use !! and := to set the variable names
      !!sum_name  := sum(!!x2, na.rm = TRUE)
    )
}

continuous_table(starwars, height)
```

* `rlang::sym()`

    + Takes a string as an input and turns it into a symbol

```{r}
my_col <- "height"
rlang::qq_show(
  starwars %>% 
    summarize(
      mean(my_col)
    )
)
```

Doesn't work because R will look for a variable named "my_col" in the data frame "starwars".

```{r}
my_col <- "height"
rlang::qq_show(
  starwars %>% 
    summarize(
      mean(!!my_col)
    )
)
```

Doesn't work because R will try to calculate the mean of the character string "height".

```{r}
my_col <- rlang::sym("height")
rlang::qq_show(
  starwars %>% 
    summarize(
      mean(!!my_col)
    )
)
```

This looks like what we would type manually.

```{r}
my_col <- rlang::sym("height")
starwars %>% 
  summarize(
    mean = mean(!!my_col, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
```

And it works as expeccted

* `rlang::syms()`

    + Like sym, but can convert multiple strings into a list of symbols
    
```{r}
my_cols <- rlang::syms(c("height", "mass"))
rlang::qq_show(
  starwars %>% 
    summarize(
      mean(!!my_cols)
    )
)
```

Notice that unquoting with !! returns a list of symbols. To unlist them, we must use the splice operator.

```{r}
my_cols <- rlang::syms(c("height", "mass"))
rlang::qq_show(
  starwars %>% 
    summarize(
      mean(!!!my_cols)
    )
)
```

Of course, to make this meaningful we need to map it over height and mass

```{r}
my_cols <- rlang::syms(c("height", "mass"))

summarise_avg <- function(data, col) {
  col <- enquo(col)
  data %>% 
    summarise(avg = mean(!!col, na.rm = TRUE))
}

results <- purrr::map_df(my_cols, summarise_avg, data = starwars)
results
```


## Example using Tidy Eval in For Loop {#for_loop}

In this example, I'm creating a table of summary statistics using the Starwars data. The table will compare some simple characteristics of the characters by species.

First, I'm going to reclassify every character as Human or Not Human

```{r}
starwars <- mutate(starwars, human = if_else(species == "Human", "Yes", "No", NA_character_))
```

Now I'm going to create the table shell

```{r}
vars = 3        # Number of vars
rows = vars + 1 # Additional row for group sample size
table <- tibble(
  Variable = vector(mode = "character", length = rows),
  Human = vector(mode = "character", length = rows),
  `Not Human` = vector(mode = "character", length = rows)
)

# N for Human
table[1, 2] <- paste0(
  "(N = ",
  filter(starwars, human == "Yes") %>% nrow() %>% format(big.mark = ","),
  ")"
)

# N for Not Human
table[1, 3] <- paste0(
  "(N = ",
  filter(starwars, human == "No") %>% nrow() %>% format(big.mark = ","),
  ")"
)
```

```{r}
table
```

Finally, I'll fill in the table using a for loop. In this case, I just want to compare the mean height, mass, and birth year of humans and non-humans.

```{r}
vars <- c(quo(height), quo(mass), quo(birth_year)) # Create vector of quotures for variables of interest

for(i in seq_along(vars)) {
  table[i + 1, ] <- starwars %>%                             # Chunk of table to receive loop output
    filter(!is.na(human)) %>% 
    group_by(human) %>% 
    summarise(Mean = mean(!!vars[[i]], na.rm = TRUE)) %>%    # Use !! with vars[[i]]
    mutate(Mean = round(Mean, 1) %>% format(nsmall = 1)) %>% 
    tidyr::spread(human, Mean) %>% 
    mutate(Variable = quo_name(vars[[i]])) %>%               # Use quo_name to get variable name for first column
    select(Variable, Yes, No)
}
```

```{r}
table
```

This works! How can I keep from having to type quo around every variable?

```{r}
vars <- quos(height, mass, birth_year)

for(i in seq_along(vars)) {
  table[i + 1, ] <- starwars %>%                             # Chunk of table to receive loop output
    filter(!is.na(human)) %>% 
    group_by(human) %>% 
    summarise(Mean = mean(!!vars[[i]], na.rm = TRUE)) %>%    # Use !! with vars[[i]]
    mutate(Mean = round(Mean, 1) %>% format(nsmall = 1)) %>% 
    tidyr::spread(human, Mean) %>% 
    mutate(Variable = quo_name(vars[[i]])) %>%               # Use quo_name to get variable name for first column
    select(Variable, Yes, No)
}
```

```{r}
table
```


## Example using Tidy Eval in Functions {#functions}

In this example, I'm creating a table of summary statistics using the Starwars data. The table will compare some simple characteristics of the characters by species.

First, I'm going to reclassify every character as Human or Not Human

```{r}
starwars <- mutate(starwars, human = if_else(species == "Human", "Yes", "No", NA_character_))
```

Now I'm going to create the table shell

# N for Human
table[1, 2] <- paste0(

  "(N = ",
  filter(starwars, human == "No") %>% nrow() %>% format(big.mark = ","),
  ")"
)
```

```{r}
table
```

Finally, I'll fill in the table using a user-defined function. In this case, I just want to compare the mean height, mass, and birth year of humans and non-humans.

```{r}
my_stats <- function(...) {
  vars <- quos(...)                                           # Creates a list of quotures from variable names
  temp <- get("table")                                        # Grabs a copy of the table shell from the environment
  temp <- temp[0, ]                                           # Only keep the column headers
  
  for(i in seq_along(vars)) {                                 # Loop over all variables in ...
    out <- quo(!!vars[[i]])                                   # Not necessary, but makes more readable.
    name <- quo_name(out)                                     # Turns variable name into string for mutate below.
    row <- starwars %>%                                       # Creates a single row of stats for the table.
      filter(!is.na(human)) %>% 
      group_by(human) %>% 
      summarise(Mean = mean(!!out, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%         # Still need !!
      mutate(Mean = round(Mean, 1) %>% format(nsmall = 1)) %>% 
      tidyr::spread(human, Mean) %>% 
      mutate(Variable = name) %>%
      select(Variable, Yes, No)
    temp <- rbind(temp, row)
  }
  temp
}
```

```{r}
table[2:4, ] <- my_stats(height, mass, birth_year)            # Notice that we no longer need to us quo
```

```{r}
table
```


## Using tidyeval with purrr{#purrr} 

I have a situation that I'm a little confused about. I think if I could understand the contrived situation below, then I could figure out my issue.

Essentially, when I use map(x, function(x) { !!x }) with tidyeval I get the result that I expect. When I try to use the purrr shortcut, i.e., map(x, ~ { !!. }) I get an error. I don't understand why. If anybody has insight that they care to share, I would really appreciate it!

A reprex is below:

This works as expected:

```{r}
vars <- quos(gender, species)

map_df(vars, function(x){
  starwars %>%
    group_by(!! x) %>%
    summarise(mean(height, na.rm = TRUE))
})
```

I'm not sure why this doesn't work:

```{r error=TRUE}
# vars <- quos(gender, species)
# 
# map_df(vars, ~ {
#   starwars %>%
#     group_by(!! .) %>%
#     summarise(mean(height, na.rm = TRUE))
# })
```

The answer is to use ".x" instead of ".":

```{r}
vars <- quos(gender, species)

map_df(vars, ~ {
  starwars %>%
    group_by(!! .x) %>%
    summarise(mean(height, na.rm = TRUE))
})
```

However, I'm not entirely sure why. When I have more time, I'd like to figure this out.

```{r}
vars <- quos(gender, species)

map(vars, function(x) {
  x
})
```


## Other Quirks and Lessons Learned {#quirks} 

### When !! doesn't work

I've noticed that using `!!` doesn't always work. At this point, I'm not exactly sure the rules related to when it works and when it doesn't work, but I do want to write down some examples and fixes.

Sometimes it's my fault:

```{r error=TRUE}
example <- function(df, var, ...) {
  x <- enquo(var)
  
  print(!!x) # This doesn't work - need to associate the quoture variable with its data frame
}
starwars %>% example(hair_color)
```

Fix: 

```{r}
example <- function(df, var, ...) {
  x <- enquo(var)
  
  df %>% select(!!x) %>% print()
}
starwars %>% example(hair_color)
```

### Unquoting inside non-dplyr functions

I‚Äôve notice some weirdness when trying to unquote quotures inside functions that are inside dplyr functions. For example, if_else inside of mutate.

```{r error=TRUE}
example <- function(df, var) {
  x <- enquo(var)
  
  df %>% 
    mutate(hair_color = if_else(!!x == "yellow", "blond", !!x))
}
starwars %>% example(hair_color)
```

Fix:

```{r}
example <- function(df, var) {
  x <- enquo(var)
  
  df %>% 
    mutate(hair_color = if_else(rlang::UQ(x) == "yellow", "blond", rlang::UQ(x)))
}
starwars %>% example(hair_color)
```

### Using a quoture to create variable name in mutate

Additionally, sometimes there is some trickiness to naming (or overwriting) a variable name inside of mutate.

```{r error=TRUE}
example <- function(df, var) {
  x <- enquo(var)
  
  df %>% 
    mutate(!!x = if_else(rlang::UQ(x) == "yellow", "blond", rlang::UQ(x)))
}
starwars %>% example(hair_color)
```

This doesn't help either:

```{r error=TRUE}
example <- function(df, var) {
  x <- enquo(var)
  
  df %>% 
    mutate(!!x := if_else(rlang::UQ(x) == "yellow", "blond", rlang::UQ(x)))
}
starwars %>% example(hair_color)
```

Fix:

Must have !! in front of quo_name(). Must use := instead of =.

```{r}
example <- function(df, var) {
  x <- enquo(var)
  
  df %>% 
    mutate(!!quo_name(x) := if_else(rlang::UQ(x) == "yellow", "blond", rlang::UQ(x)))
}
starwars %>% example(hair_color)
```

### Using a quoture to turn a variable name into a constant value

When I'm looping over many variables, I often want to create a variable in my output called "characteristic" or "variable" that captures the current variable name as a value.

```{r}
example <- function(df, var) {
  x <- enquo(var)                              # Make sure to use enquo here
  
  df %>% 
    summarise(
      Mean = mean(!!x, na.rm = TRUE)
    ) %>% 
    mutate(Characteristic = !!quo_name(x)) %>% # Make sure to use !!quo_name()
    select(Characteristic, Mean)
}

starwars %>% example(height)
```

### Convert a string to a quoture

Here are some useful websites:

https://github.com/tidyverse/rlang/issues/116

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27975124/pass-arguments-to-dplyr-functions/44594223#44594223

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44593596/how-to-pass-strings-denoting-expressions-to-dplyr-0-7-verbs/44593617#44593617

Sometimes, I want to pass a variable name as a string to a function. It then needs to be converted to a quoture for evaluation.

#### Simple example - Now this works

```{r}
my_col <- names(starwars[2]) # Have a variable name as a quoted string
my_col <- "mass"
starwars %>% select(!!my_col) # Now this works
```

#### When the string is created inside the function

```{r}
starwars$height_squared <- starwars$height**2
```


```{r}
example <- function(df, var) {
  
  x <- enquo(var)  # First, turn var without the suffix into a quoture - must be first
  squared <- paste(quo_name(x), "squared", sep = "_") # Must use quo_name()
  
  df %>% 
    summarise(
      Mean = mean(!!squared, na.rm = TRUE)
    )
}

starwars %>% example(height)
```

Fix (Method prefered by Hadley and Lionel):

```{r}
example <- function(df, var) {
  
  x <- enquo(var)  # First, turn var without the suffix into a quoture - must be first
  squared <- paste(quo_name(x), "squared", sep = "_") # Must use quo_name()
  squared <- rlang::sym(squared) # Wrap with sym()

  df %>%
    summarise(
      Mean = mean(!!squared, na.rm = TRUE)
    )
}

starwars %>% example(height)
```

Or:

```{r}
example <- function(df, var) {
  
  x <- enquo(var)  # First, turn var without the suffix into a quoture - must be first
  squared <- paste(quo_name(x), "squared", sep = "_") # Must use quo_name()
  squared <- as.name(squared) # Wrap with as.name()

  df %>%
    summarise(
      Mean = mean(!!squared, na.rm = TRUE)
    )
}

starwars %>% example(height)
```

Or:

```{r}
example <- function(df, var) {
  
  x <- enquo(var)  # First, turn var without the suffix into a quoture - must be first
  squared <- paste(quo_name(x), "squared", sep = "_") # Must use quo_name()
  squared <- rlang::parse_quosure(squared) # Wrap with parse_quosure

  df %>%
    summarise(
      Mean = mean(!!squared, na.rm = TRUE)
    )
}

starwars %>% example(height)
```

#### Grouping by all columns in the data frame

Ran into this situation while checking for duplicate rows in APS data (DETECT pilot test)

```{r error=TRUE}
starwars_2 <- starwars %>% select(-films, -vehicles, -starships) # Remove list columns

starwars_2 %>% 
  group_by(names(starwars)) %>% 
  filter(n() > 1) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  select(n)
```

Fix: In this case, we could have used the built-in group_by_all

```{r}
starwars_2 <- starwars %>% select(-films, -vehicles, -starships) # Remove list columns

starwars_2 %>% 
  group_by_all() %>% 
  filter(n() > 1) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  select(n)
```

And, there are no duplicates.

Another, more general solution for using all column names is:

```{r}
starwars_2 <- starwars %>% select(-films, -vehicles, -starships) # Remove list columns

my_cols <- starwars_2 %>% names() %>% rlang::syms()

starwars_2 %>% 
  group_by(!!!my_cols) %>% # Remember to use splice '!!!'
  filter(n() > 1) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  select(n)
```

## Example I created for Steph Yap

Need to clean this up, but I don't have time now.

**Here is a worked example using some toy data**

aps_cleaned <- tibble(
  case_num = 1:3,
  valid_physical_neglect = c(0, 1, 0),
  valid_sexual_abuse = 0
)
discrepancies_valid_physical_neglect <-tibble(
  case_num = 1,
  valid_physical_neglect = 1
)
discrepancies_valid_sexual_abuse <- tibble(
  case_num = 3,
  valid_sexual_abuse = 1
)

**Create the function**

Here is a refernce to help with the tidy evaluation stuff: https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/programming.html

join_aps <- function(.data = aps_cleaned, join_df, valid_col) {
  # Create column names to use in the code below
  col_x <- sym(paste0(quo_name(enquo(valid_col)), ".x"))
  col_y <- sym(paste0(quo_name(enquo(valid_col)), ".y"))
  
  .data %>% 
    left_join(join_df, by = "case_num") %>% 
    mutate(
      "{{valid_col}}_cleaned" := if_else(
        is.na({{ col_y }}), {{ col_x }}, {{ col_y }}
      )
    )
}

**Test function**

aps_cleaned %>% 
  join_aps(discrepancies_valid_physical_neglect, valid_physical_neglect)


## Other questions / notes / reminders {#other}

* Go back and add more basic information about rlang::sym() and some of the other rlang functions

* There is also some function to see what is going on "under the hood". I don't recall what it is right now, but I should probably discuss it as well.
