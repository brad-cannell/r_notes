## ⭐️Overview

This chapter is about plotting out populations (usually of people) and samples (usually of people). This are mostly useful for teaching and training purposes

## 📦Load packages

```{r message=FALSE}
library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
library(ggplot2, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
library(freqtables)
```


## 🔢Simulate data 

```{r}
set.seed(123)
df <- tibble(
  medication = c(rep(0, 10), rep(1, 10)),
  fall = c(rep(0, 8), rep(1, 2), rep(0, 6), rep(1, 4))
)
```

```{r}
table(df)
```

Need to reorder this 1,0 instead of 0,1. Work on this in the contingency tables file.
