## ⭐️Overview

This chapter contains blogdown notes. I started writing it as I was creating my [bradcannell](www.bradcannell.com) website on 2021-12-21.

## 📦Load packages

```{r message=FALSE}

library(blogdown)
```

When creating my site, I closely followed the steps outlined in [Up & running with blogdown in 2021](https://www.apreshill.com/blog/2020-12-new-year-new-blogdown/).

Below there are some additional notes, and solutions I used for issues I came up against along the way.


## Blogdown commands to remember

When you start a new R session, it can be useful to view a preview of the site in the Viewer window. You do that with

```{r eval=FALSE}
blogdown::serve_site()
```

To check content

```{r eval=FALSE}
blogdown::check_content()
```

To check the status of Netlify

```{r eval=FALSE}
blogdown::check_netlify()
```

In the past I got the following error:   

> Checking netlify.toml...    
Error in find_config() :     
  Cannot find the configuration file config.toml | config.yaml | config/_default/config.toml | config/_default/config.yaml of the website   

Ultimately, I just had to quit R and reopen -- not just restart R session.

To check the Hugo versions

```{r eval=FALSE}
blogdown::check_hugo()
```

Let’s run one final check, which wraps all 5 checking functions we’ve used so far into a single final checklist:

```{r eval=FALSE}
blogdown::check_site()
```



## Editing widget metadata

content > home


## Editing about widget content

This includes degrees and social media stuff. 

authors > admin > _index.md


## Adjusting site configuration files

For example, nav bar.

config > _default > 


## Other little adjustments

**Banner image** 
To make my banner image full screen I had to add 

advanced:
  css_class: fullscreen
  
To content > home > banner.md

**Map zoom in the contacts widget** 

I changed the map zoom in the contacts widget to 9 instead of 15. I changed it in `params.yaml`.

**Copyright**

I added a copyright to the website in config.yaml
I removed the license stuff from the footer in params.yaml. Search for copyright_license.


## Changing the domain

* [Netlify custom domains](https://docs.netlify.com/domains-https/custom-domains/)   
* [Configure external DNS for a custom domain](https://docs.netlify.com/domains-https/custom-domains/configure-external-dns/)   

I had to add bradcannell.netlify.app to the www CNAME on godaddy.


## Error fixes

### blogdown::check_netlify()

> Checking netlify.toml...    
Error in find_config() :     
  Cannot find the configuration file config.toml | config.yaml | config/_default/config.toml | config/_default/config.yaml of the website   

Ultimately, I just had to quit R and reopen -- not just restart R session.
