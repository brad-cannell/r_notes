# Bookdown: Creating Book Chapters {#book-chapters}

Chapters should pretty much just be about one distinct idea. Give some more thought to defining this more clearly. I think it will be important as I start incorporating the epidemiology stuff. Also, it should help with making things easier to find.

Heading guidelines:
* Useful for finding what you are looking for.

## Chapter overview

Very brief description of what they can expect. 

By the end of this chapter, we will be able to:
1. Placeholder
2. Placeholder

* Awesome if you can start with a funny picture or a cool quote.

## Motivating example

Recall that one of my [goals][Goals] is "To start each concept with the end result and then deconstruct how we arrived at that result, where possible. I find that it is easier for me to understand new concepts when learning them as a component of a final product."

We won't necessarily do this for every chapter (e.g., installing R and RStudio) if doing so doesn't make sense.

## Body

### Language

Use "we" and "our" language. Make it friendly and informal. 

### Text conventions

* **Bold** text is used to highlight important **terms**, file names, and file extensions.
  - Not every bolded term needs to go in the glossary. Use your best judgment.

* `Highlighted inline code` is used to emphasize small sections of R code and program elements such as variable or function names.

### Special sections

<p class="note"> üóí**Side Note:** This is an example note. </p>

<p class="warning"> ‚ö†Ô∏è**Warning:** This is an example warning </p>

### Images

```{r exampe-bookdown-img, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/06_presenting_results/bookdown_creating_book_chapters/example_bookdown_image.png")
```

* Don't forget to add "echo=FALSE" to the code chunk.

* To cross-reference figures. Name the figure in the code chunk (e.g., `{r console, echo=FALSE})`. Then add `\@ref(fig:console)` to the text.
  - The figure reference should go outside of punctuation. With a space.

* Every figure doesn't need a caption. It can actually make things look sloppy. The only figures that NEED a caption are those figures that are cross-referenced.

* Because of the way the files are structured, You won't be able to see pictures directly in the Rmd files without including "../../" on the front the file paths. However, having "../../" on the front of the file paths prevents the book from building appropriately.

### Code blocks

```{r}

```

üëÜ**Here's what we did above:**

Use unordered lists for these sections. It allows for nested lists and code. Add line breaks in between the bullets.

```{eval=FALSE}
<ul>
  <li>You can type `?mutate` into your R console to view the help documentation for this function and follow along with the explanation below./li>
  
  <li></li>
  
  <li></li>
</ul>
```


## Cross-references

* To cross-reference figures. Name the figure in the code chunk (e.g., `{r console, echo=FALSE})`. Then add `\@ref(fig:console)` to the text.
  - The figure reference should go outside of punctuation. With a space.
  
* To cross-reference chapters: https://happygitwithr.com/bookdown-cheat-sheet.html
  - Add CSS id the behind the header # How to use odds ratios {#ors}
  - Refer to it like this: The the [chapter on odds ratios](#ors)
  - Capitalize first letter when cross-referencing the chapter by name -- the Let's get programming chapter. Written as "the [Let's get programming] chapter."  
  - Don't capitalize the first letter when describing the contents of a chapter in the cross-reference -- the chapter on exporting data. Written as "We were first introduced to [factor vectors][Factor vectors] in the chapter.."
  
  
## Citations

For more details, see [Yihui Xie's Bookdown book](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/citations.html).

1. Add whatever you want to cite to Paperpile.   
2. Navigate to Paperpile.   
3. Click on the document/article you want to cite.   
4. Click the drop-down arrow next to the "Cite" button.   
5. Click the BibTeX option. This will copy a BibTeX citation to your clipboard.    

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/06_presenting_results/bookdown_creating_book_chapters/paperpile.png")
```

6. In RStudio, open `book.bib`, which should be in your book's root directory.   
7. Paste the BibTeX citation into `book.bib`. Order the citations alphabetically by author's last name. Save.   

For example, here is the `book.bib` entry for the Yihui Xie's bookdown book:

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/06_presenting_results/bookdown_creating_book_chapters/bibtex_example.png")
```

Then, to cite that book, type `@key` where you want the citation to appear -- the **key** part of `@key` is marked in the example above. So, I'm citing Yihui Xie's bookdown book at the end of this sentence by typing `@Xie2021-pn` after the period _with a space in between_. @Xie2021-pn

<p class="note"> üóí**Side Note:** You can change the citation style using the `csl:` parameter in `index.Rmd`. I typically use `csl: ama.csl`, but you can download other formats from https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles. </p>


## Previewing the chapter

* Supposed to use "bookdown::preview_chapter("03_what_is_r.Rmd")" to preview chapters. 
  - I can't get this to work for some reason. I created a new project that I can use a test environment. 
  - It's in "R4Epi chapters in progress/bookdown_test_environment". You have to build the whole book, but it should go fast because I don't have all the chapters.

### Miscelaneous 

* Make liberal use of emojis.
* Start making videos to supplement content.

## Additional resources: function to check

Links to cheat sheets, websites, and videos.

## Key terms : function to add to appendix 

Key terms covered in this chapter.

## Final example code : function to add to appendix

Succinct recap of the code used in this chapter without any explanation of how it works. You can use this as a quick reference later.

We won't necessarily do this for every chapter (e.g., installing R and RStudio) if doing so doesn't make sense.
