# Bookdown: Creating Book Chapters {#book-chapters}

Chapters should pretty much just be about one distinct idea. Give some more thought to defining this more clearly. I think it will be important as I start incorporating the epidemiology stuff. Also, it should help with making things easier to find.

Heading guidelines:
* Useful for finding what you are looking for.

## Chapter overview

Very brief description of what they can expect. 

By the end of this chapter, we will be able to:
1. Placeholder
2. Placeholder

* Awesome if you can start with a funny picture or a cool quote.

## Motivating example

Recall that one of my [goals][Goals] is "To start each concept with the end result and then deconstruct how we arrived at that result, where possible. I find that it is easier for me to understand new concepts when learning them as a component of a final product."

We won't necessarily do this for every chapter (e.g., installing R and RStudio) if doing so doesn't make sense.

## Body

### Language

Use "we" and "our" language. Make it friendly and informal. 

### Text conventions

* **Bold** text is used to highlight important **terms**, file names, and file extensions.
  - Not every bolded term needs to go in the glossary. Use your best judgment.

* `Highlighted inline code` is used to emphasize small sections of R code and program elements such as variable or function names.

### Special sections

<p class="note"> üóí**Side Note:** This is an example note. </p>

<p class="warning"> ‚ö†Ô∏è**Warning:** This is an example warning </p>

### Images

```{r exampe-bookdown-img, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/06_presenting_results/bookdown_creating_book_chapters/example_bookdown_image.png")
```

* Don't forget to add "echo=FALSE" to the code chunk.

* Details on cross-referencing figures are given [below](#cr-figs).  

* Every figure doesn't need a caption. It can actually make things look sloppy. The only figures that NEED a caption are those figures that are cross-referenced.

* Because of the way the files are structured, You won't be able to see pictures directly in the Rmd files without including "../../" on the front the file paths. However, having "../../" on the front of the file paths prevents the book from building appropriately.

### Code blocks

```{r}

```

üëÜ**Here's what we did above:**

Use unordered lists for these sections. It allows for nested lists and code. Add line breaks in between the bullets.

```{eval=FALSE}
<ul>
  <li>You can type `?mutate` into your R console to view the help documentation for this function and follow along with the explanation below./li>
  
  <li></li>
  
  <li></li>
</ul>
```


## Cross-references

### Cross-referencing figures {#cr-figs}

To cross-reference figures:

  1. Label the code chunk that contains the figure (e.g., `{r label, echo=FALSE})`.    
  2. Give the code chunk that contains the figure a caption (e.g., `{r label, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Some text."})`)
  2. Then add `\@ref(fig:exampe-bookdown-img)` to the text where you want to cross-reference the figure.   

<p class="warning"> ‚ö†Ô∏è**Warning:** The figure reference must go outside of punctuation. With a space. </p>

<p class="warning"> ‚ö†Ô∏è**Warning:** If you want to cross-reference figures or tables generated from a code chunk, please make sure the chunk label only contains alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9), slashes (/), or dashes (-). </p>

<p class="warning"> ‚ö†Ô∏è**Warning:** If you want to cross-reference figures or tables generated from a code chunk, you must give the code chunk a caption. </p>

Example:   

  * The sentence below is written as "As seen in the figure below. `\@ref(fig:paperpile)`"    
  * As seen in the figure below. \@ref(fig:paperpile)

### Cross-referencing chapters

There are a couple different ways you can cross-reference other chapters or other sections of the book. This is adapted from Jenny Bryan's [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](https://happygitwithr.com/bookdown-cheat-sheet.html) book.

#### Method 1.

You can add a CSS id the behind the header using a hashtag inside curly braces (i.e., `{#id}`). Later, you can reference that section by writing the hash id inside parentheses (i.e., `[some text to link](#id)`).  

Method 1 is a good method when the section name is difficult or unwieldy to write out. It may also just be a good idea when you know ahead of time that you will want to cross-reference a section.     

Example:    

  * I added the CSS id `{#cr-figs}` to the section above called "Cross-referencing figures".   
  * The sentence below is written as "`See the section above on [cross-referencing figures](#cr-figs)`".   
  * See the section above on [cross-referencing figures](#cr-figs).   
  
#### Method 2

You can add a CSS id the behind the header using a hashtag inside curly braces (i.e., `{#id}`). Later, you can use the `\@ref(#id)` format to make the cross-reference appear as a linked chapter/section number rather than linked text. 

Method 1 & 2 are good methods when the section name is difficult or unwieldy to write out. They may also just be a good idea when you know ahead of time that you will want to cross-reference a section. The difference is really just a matter of style.     
  
Example:    

  * I added the CSS id `{#cr-figs}` to the section above called "Cross-referencing figures".   
  * The sentence below is written as "`See the section \@ref(cr-figs) above about cross-referencing figures.`".   
  * See the section \@ref(cr-figs) above about cross-referencing figures.    
  * Notice that I did NOT include the hashtag symbol when referencing the section.   
  
#### Method 3

Simply write out the chapter/section header name inside square brackets (i.e., `[Section header name]` to create a text link to the chapter/section header. 

Example:    

  * This section is titled "Cross-references".       
  * The sentence below is written as "`See the [cross-references] section above.`".   
  * See the [cross-references] section above.    
  
<p class="warning"> ‚ö†Ô∏è**Warning:** When using the chapter/section name inside square brackets, make sure to replace spaces with dashes (-). </p>
  
#### Method 4

Write out some text that you want linked to the chapter/section header inside of square brackets, then immediately follow it with the chapter/section header name inside square brackets (i.e., `[linked text][Section header name]` to create a text link to the chapter/section header. 

Example:    

  * This section is titled "Cross-references".       
  * The sentence below is written as "`See the [section above on cross-referencing][Cross-references]`".   
  * See the [section above on cross-referencing][Cross-references].    

## Citations

For more details, see [Yihui Xie's Bookdown book](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/citations.html).

1. Add whatever you want to cite to Paperpile.   
2. Navigate to Paperpile.   
3. Click on the document/article you want to cite.   
4. Click the drop-down arrow next to the "Cite" button.   
5. Click the BibTeX option. This will copy a BibTeX citation to your clipboard.    

```{r paperpile, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="A screenshot of selecting BibTex in PaperPile."}
knitr::include_graphics("img/06_presenting_results/bookdown_creating_book_chapters/paperpile.png")
```

6. In RStudio, open `book.bib`, which should be in your book's root directory.   
7. Paste the BibTeX citation into `book.bib`. Order the citations alphabetically by author's last name. Save.   

For example, here is the `book.bib` entry for the Yihui Xie's bookdown book:

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/06_presenting_results/bookdown_creating_book_chapters/bibtex_example.png")
```

Then, to cite that book, type `@key` where you want the citation to appear -- the **key** part of `@key` is marked in the example above. So, I'm citing Yihui Xie's bookdown book at the end of this sentence by typing `@Xie2021-pn` after the period _with a space in between_. @Xie2021-pn

<p class="note"> üóí**Side Note:** You can change the citation style using the `csl:` parameter in `index.Rmd`. I typically use `csl: ama.csl`, but you can download other formats from https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles. </p>


## Previewing the chapter

* Supposed to use "bookdown::preview_chapter("03_what_is_r.Rmd")" to preview chapters. 
  - I can't get this to work for some reason. I created a new project that I can use a test environment. 
  - It's in "R4Epi chapters in progress/bookdown_test_environment". You have to build the whole book, but it should go fast because I don't have all the chapters.

### Miscelaneous 

* Make liberal use of emojis.
* Start making videos to supplement content.

## Additional resources: function to check

## Key terms : function to add to appendix 

Key terms covered in this chapter.

## Final example code : function to add to appendix

Succinct recap of the code used in this chapter without any explanation of how it works. You can use this as a quick reference later.

We won't necessarily do this for every chapter (e.g., installing R and RStudio) if doing so doesn't make sense.
