## ⭐️Overview

This chapter is about language I often need to use and adapt for peer reviewed publications.

## Statistical software

In manuscripts, I often want to say something about the software I used to conduct the statistical analyses. Here is an example.

### R

> Statistical analyses were conducted using R version 4.1.0 (R Core Team, 2021) in RStudio version 1.4.1717 (RStudio Team, 2021) with the following packages: tidyverse (Wickham et al., 2019), freqtables (Cannell, 2020), meantables (Cannell, 2020).

The functions below can be used to get citations and version numbers.

```{r}
citation()
```

```{r}
R.Version()$version.string
```

```{r error=TRUE}
# Won't run when I build book, but this is how you get the RStudio version number
rstudioapi::versionInfo()
```


```{r}
citation("tidyverse")
```

```{r}
citation("freqtables")
```

### Stata

> All analyses were conducted using Stata 13 (StataCorp, 2013)

### SAS 

> All analyses were completed with SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). 

## IRB

> The Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects at the University of Texas Health Science Center approved this project.

> The design and conduct of this study was reviewed and approved by the Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston.

> The University of Florida’s IRB approved the use of de-identified data to conduct this analysis.
