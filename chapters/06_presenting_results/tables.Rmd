## ⭐️Overview

This chapter is about **formatting and presenting statistical results in tables.**

The immediate results of statistical analyses are rarely fit for general consumption. This chapter walks through strategies and functions we can use to make our results ready for presentation/dissemination.

Tables are one of the most popular ways to present information to our audience. When our goal is to show our readers precise numerical summaries of our data, the exact values that resulted from our analysis are important.

However, the specific details that we may want to present from table to table, or the way in which we want to present them, can vary widely. For example, an initial table of descriptive information about our participants may or may not be stratified by subgroups of interest. Additionally, it may include variables of different types, and for any given type, it may include various different kinds of numerical summaries. Further, there are numerous types of inferential models that result in numerical summaries that we may want to present in a table. For these reasons, it is difficult to create a good one-size-fits-all approach to automating the process of making results ready for presentation and dissemination.

Having said that, below we walk through some basic strategies for automating the processes of putting results into presentation-ready summary tables -- and in a way that makes updating them (which happens A LOT) as painless as possible.


## Projects to review and incorporate

stroke study -> table_characteristics_by_network.Rmd to see an example of doing this with purrr::map. When you have time, you should add an example into this document.

See Sun Study Report Template for a good example of automating this with Officer and Flextable.

I used a little different method in Link2Care > paper_smartphone_app > table_use_app.Rmd. Try to work some of that in below. 

/Users/bradcannell/Dropbox/01 Research/Elder Abuse/DETECT NIH RFA-AG-18-010/LEAD Panel/summarise_lead_votes/report_filemaker.Rmd

This chapter also kind of overlaps with the [Flexdashboard] and [Officer] chapters. At some point, I should think about the best way to link and organize the chapters. Another option is to put all the flextable stuff in this chapter. I might still want a separate chapter about officer.

## 🔢Simulate data 

Have you noticed how we will often calculate the same statistical measures for many different variables in our data? For example, let’s say that we have some pretty standard data about some study participants that looks like this:

```{r}
study <- tibble(
  id        = c(1:100),
  age       = c(32, 30, 32, 29, 24, 38, 25, 24, 48, 29, 22, 29, 24, 28, 24, 25, 
                25, 22, 25, 24, 25, 24, 23, 24, 31, 24, 29, 24, 22, 23, 26, 23, 
                24, 25, 24, 33, 27, 25, 26, 26, 26, 26, 26, 27, 24, 43, 25, 24, 
                27, 28, 29, 24, 26, 28, 25, 24, 26, 24, 26, 31, 24, 26, 31, 34,

## 🔵 Example: Table 1

This first example is perhaps the most common type of table we will create -- a Table 1 -- or basic descriptive table about our participants. 

Let's start by looking at a complete example:

```{r random-pic-from-url, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/06_presenting_results/example_table_1.png")
```

Here is the minimum code needed to achieve the result in the screenshot above. Below, we will break this code down step-by-step.

```{r}
n_outcome <- study %>% 
  count(outcome) %>% 
  pull(n) %>%
  set_names(levels(study$outcome))
```

```{r}
cont_stats_fn <- function(.data, .outcome, .pred, .digits = 0) {
  .data %>% 
    # Calculations
    group_by({{ .outcome }}) %>% 
    mean_table({{ .pred }}) %>% 
    # Format statistics
    mean_format("mean (lcl - ucl)", name = "mean_95") %>% 
    select(var = response_var, group_cat, mean_95) %>% 
    # Display by group_cat
    pivot_wider(
      names_from = "group_cat",
      values_from = "mean_95"
    ) %>%
    # Add a blank row
    add_row(var = "")
}
```

```{r}
cat_stats_fn <- function(.data, .outcome, .pred, .digits = 0) {
  .data %>% 
    # Remove rows with missing values
    filter(!is.na({{ .pred }})) %>% 
    # Calculations
    freq_table({{ .outcome }}, {{ .pred }}) %>%  
    # Format statistics
    freq_format("percent_row (lcl_row - ucl_row)", name = "percent_95", digits = 2) %>%
    # Keep columns of interest
    select(row_cat, var = col_var, col_cat, percent_95) %>% 
    # Display by row_cat
    pivot_wider(
      names_from = "row_cat",
      values_from = "percent_95"
    ) %>% 
    # Add spaces in front of category labels
    mutate(col_cat = paste0("  ", col_cat)) %>% 
    # Slide category labels under row variable label
    add_row(col_cat = !!quo_name(enquo(.pred)), .before = 1) %>% 
    select(-var, var = col_cat) %>% 
    # Add a blank row
    add_row(var = "")
}
```

```{r}
cont_cols <- c("age", "ht_in", "wt_lbs", "bmi")
```

```{r}
cat_cols <- c("age_group", "gender", "bmi_4cat", "exposure")
```

```{r}
stats_list <- c(
  cont_cols %>%
    set_names(cont_cols) %>% 
    map(~ cont_stats_fn(study, outcome, !! sym(.x))),
  cat_cols %>%
    set_names(cat_cols) %>% 
    map(~ cat_stats_fn(study, outcome, !! sym(.x)))
)
```

```{r}
table_1 <- map_dfr(
  .x = c("exposure", "age", "age_group", "gender", "ht_in", "wt_lbs", "bmi", "bmi_4cat"),
  .f = ~ bind_rows(stats_list[[.x]])
)
```

```{r}
table_1_ft <- flextable(table_1) %>% 
  # Change column widths. figure out through trial and error
  width(width = c(2.5, 2.01, 2.01)) %>%

    i = c(5, 15, 17), j = 1,
    value = as_paragraph(
      c("Age in years.", "Height in inches.", "Weight in pounds.")
    )
  ) %>%

After cleaning your data, which isn't covered in this chapter, a typical workflow for creating a Table 1 like this may look like the following:

### Step 1. Calculate the outcome distribution

As our first step, we typically want to see how many people have each value for the outcome of interest. We will also store these values so that we can add them to our table header as (N = XX) later.

```{r}
n_outcome <- study %>% 
  count(outcome) %>% 
  pull(n) %>%
  set_names(levels(study$outcome))

n_outcome
```

### Step 2. Prepare to calculate summary statistics 

#### Calculate statistics for single variables

Eventually, we are going to want to calculate summary statistics for multiple different variables that will go into our Table 1. Before we do that, it can be useful to write code that will calculate the summary statistics we are interested in for one continuous variable and one categorical variable. Later, we can use [iterative processing](https://www.r4epi.com/introduction-to-repeated-operations.html) to apply that code to all of the variables we are interested in.

<div class="note"> 🗒**Side Note:** This chapter isn't about how to calculate or interpret all the various different statistics we may want to calculate from project to project. For more details on descriptive statistics see:

* [R4Epi Descriptive Analysis](https://www.r4epi.com/introduction-to-descriptive-analysis.html)    
* [meantables](placeholder)   
* [freqtables](placeholder)    
</div>

##### One continuous variable

In this example, we want to calculate the mean and 95% confidence interval for continuous variables. Because this is an example, we will break it down into multiple steps. In a real analysis, we would probably put all of the code in this section into a single code chunk. 

**Calculations**

Do the basic calculations. Here we are using the `mean_table()` function from the `meantables` package. 

```{r}
one_cont_var <- study %>% 
  group_by(outcome) %>% 
  mean_table(age) %>% 
  print()
```

**Format statistics**

Combine the mean and 95% confidence interval into a single variable and keep only the columns of interest for reporting.

Additionally, we no longer need the `group_var` column and we will rename `response_var` to `var` to make it easier to row bind with our categorical variables later.

```{r}
one_cont_var <- one_cont_var %>% 
  mean_format("mean (lcl - ucl)", name = "mean_95") %>% 
  select(var = response_var, group_cat, mean_95) %>% 
  print()
```

**Display by group_cat**

In the final table, we don't want the results stacked on top of each other vertically, we want them spread out horizontally across columns -- one column for each level (i.e., category) of our outcome variable. We can use `pivot_wider()` from the `tidyr` package to do this. See the chapter on [restructuring data frames](https://www.r4epi.com/restructuring-data-frames.html) for more info on pivot_wider.

```{r}
one_cont_var <- one_cont_var %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = "group_cat",
    values_from = "mean_95"
  ) %>% 
  print()
```

**Add a blank row**

Finally, we want to add a blank row to the bottom of our results table. This will create some vertical separation between variables in our table when we eventually row bind all the variables together.

```{r}
one_cont_var <- one_cont_var %>%
  add_row(var = "") %>% 
  print()
```

**Putting it all together**

And that's the final result we are looking for. Putting it all together, it looks like this:

```{r}
one_cont_var <- study %>% 
  # Calculations
  group_by(outcome) %>% 
  mean_table(age) %>% 
  # Format statistics
  mean_format("mean (lcl - ucl)", name = "mean_95") %>% 
  select(var = response_var, group_cat, mean_95) %>% 
  # Display by group_cat
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = "group_cat",
    values_from = "mean_95"
  ) %>%
  # Add a blank row
  add_row(var = "") %>% 
  print()
```

[Below](#table-functions-1), we will combine the whole sequence together into a function that we can call repeatedly on each of our continuous variables.

##### One categorical variable

In this example, we want to calculate the row percent and 95% confidence interval for categorical variables. Because this is an example, we will break it down into multiple steps. In a real analysis, we would probably put all of the code in this section into a single code chunk. 

**Calculations**

Do the basic calculations. Here we are using the `freq_table()` function from the `freqtables` package. 

```{r}
one_cat_var <- study %>% 
  freq_table(outcome, age_group) %>% 
  print()
```

**Format statistics**

Combine the row percent and 95% confidence interval into a single variable and keep only the columns of interest for reporting.

```{r}
one_cat_var <- one_cat_var %>%
  freq_format("percent_row (lcl_row - ucl_row)", name = "percent_95", digits = 2) %>% 
  print()
```

**Keep columns of interest**

We only need the values from `row_cat`, `col_var`, `col_cat`, and `percent_95` in our final table. Additionally, we will rename `col_var` to `var` to make it easier to row bind with our continuous variables later.

```{r}
one_cat_var <- one_cat_var %>%
  select(row_cat, var = col_var, col_cat, percent_95) %>% 
  print()
```

**Display by row_cat**

In the final table, we don't want all of the results stacked on top of each other vertically as it is above. Instead, we want the results spread out horizontally across columns -- one column for each level (i.e., category) of our outcome variable. We can use `pivot_wider()` from the `tidyr` package to do this. See the chapter on [restructuring data frames](https://www.r4epi.com/restructuring-data-frames.html) for more info on pivot_wider. 

```{r}
one_cat_var <- one_cat_var %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = "row_cat",
    values_from = "percent_95"
  ) %>% 
  print()
```

**Add spaces in front of category labels**

In our final Word table, we will want our category labels (e.g., "Younger than 30" and "30 and Older") to be indented slightly relative to the row variable label (e.g., "age_group"). We will go ahead and add 2 spaces now. 

<p class="note"> 🗒**Side Note:** The spaces won't be visible while testing in RStudio, but they will show up in the final Word document. </p>

```{r}
one_cat_var <- one_cat_var %>% 
  mutate(col_cat = paste0("  ", col_cat)) %>%
  print()
```

**Slide category labels under row variable label**

In our final Word table, we will want our category labels (e.g., "Younger than 30" and "30 and Older") to be in the same column -- and underneath -- the row variable label (e.g., "age_group"). 

In other words, we want our final table to look like this:

| Characteristic    | No                    | Yes                   |
| :---------------- | :-------------------: | :-------------------: |
| Age Group         |                       |                       |
|   Younger than 30 | 56.14 (42.86 - 68.59) | 65.12 (49.54 - 78.02) |
|   30 and Older    | 43.86 (31.41 - 57.14) | 34.88 (21.98 - 50.46) |

Instead of this:

| Characteristic | Category         | No                    | Yes                   |
| :------------- | :--------------: | :-------------------: | :-------------------: |
| Age Group      | Younger than 30  | 56.14 (42.86 - 68.59) | 65.12 (49.54 - 78.02) |
| Age group      | 30 and Older     | 43.86 (31.41 - 57.14) | 34.88 (21.98 - 50.46) |

To do this, we will: 

1. Add a new top row to the data frame that will contain the variable label in the current col_cat column.   
2. Drop the current `var` column, which is no longer needed.   
3. Rename the `col_cat` to `var` to make it easier to row bind with our categorical variables later.   

```{r}
one_cat_var <- one_cat_var %>%
  add_row(col_cat = "age_group", .before = 1) %>%
  select(-var, var = col_cat) %>% 
  print()
```

**Add a blank row**

Finally, we want to add a blank row to the bottom of our results table. This will create some vertical separation between variables in our table when we eventually row bind all the variables together.

```{r}
one_cat_var <- one_cat_var %>%
  add_row(var = "") %>% 
  print()
```

**Putting it all together**

And that's the final result we are looking for. Putting it all together, it looks like this:

```{r}
one_cat_var <- study %>% 
  # Calculations
  freq_table(outcome, age_group) %>%  
  # Format statistics
  freq_format("percent_row (lcl_row - ucl_row)", name = "percent_95", digits = 2) %>%
  # Keep columns of interest
  select(row_cat, var = col_var, col_cat, percent_95) %>% 
  # Display by row_cat
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = "row_cat",
    values_from = "percent_95"
  ) %>% 
  # Add spaces in front of category labels
  mutate(col_cat = paste0("  ", col_cat)) %>% 
  # Slide category labels under row variable label
  add_row(col_cat = "age_group", .before = 1) %>% 
  select(-var, var = col_cat) %>% 
  # Add a blank row
  add_row(var = "") %>% 
  print()
```

[Below](#table-functions-1), we will combine the whole sequence together into a function that we can call repeatedly on each of our continuous variables.

#### Create helper functions {#table-functions-1}

Above, we saw how to calculate the summary statistics we wanted for one continuous variable and one categorical variable. We could repeat that process for each variable we are interested in using copy and paste, but it is much more efficient and much less error prone to wrap those processes in a function that we can call repeatedly on each variable we want to analyze. That's what we will do in this section.

In each of the code chunks below, all we're going to do is cut the copy the code from above, paste it below, wrap it in the `function()` function, and then make a few tweaks that will allow us to repeatedly pass variable names into the code. See the chapter on [writing functions](https://www.r4epi.com/writing-functions.html) for more info on pivot_wider.

##### Continuous stats function

```{r}
cont_stats_fn <- function(.data, .outcome, .pred, .digits = 0) {
  .data %>% 
    # Calculations
    group_by({{ .outcome }}) %>% 
    mean_table({{ .pred }}) %>% 
    # Format statistics
    mean_format("mean (lcl - ucl)", name = "mean_95") %>% 
    select(var = response_var, group_cat, mean_95) %>% 
    # Display by group_cat
    pivot_wider(
      names_from = "group_cat",
      values_from = "mean_95"
    ) %>%
    # Add a blank row
    add_row(var = "")
}

# For testing
cont_stats_fn(study, outcome, age, .digits = 1)
```

##### Categoorical stats function

```{r}
cat_stats_fn <- function(.data, .outcome, .pred, .digits = 0) {
  .data %>% 
    # Remove rows with missing values
    filter(!is.na({{ .pred }})) %>% 
    # Calculations
    freq_table({{ .outcome }}, {{ .pred }}) %>%  
    # Format statistics
    freq_format("percent_row (lcl_row - ucl_row)", name = "percent_95", digits = 2) %>%
    # Keep columns of interest
    select(row_cat, var = col_var, col_cat, percent_95) %>% 
    # Display by row_cat
    pivot_wider(
      names_from = "row_cat",
      values_from = "percent_95"
    ) %>% 
    # Add spaces in front of category labels
    mutate(col_cat = paste0("  ", col_cat)) %>% 
    # Slide category labels under row variable label
    add_row(col_cat = !!quo_name(enquo(.pred)), .before = 1) %>% 
    select(-var, var = col_cat) %>% 
    # Add a blank row
    add_row(var = "")
}

# For testing
cat_stats_fn(study, outcome, bmi_4cat, .digits = 1)
```

### Step 3. Create a data frame that contains our summary statistics

In general, we won't want to __present__ or __distribute__ summary statistics in the form of an R data frame. However, an preliminary step in creating our final table -- regardless of the method we use -- will usually be to create an R data frame that contains our summary statistics of interest.

The next step in this proc

```{r}
cont_cols <- c("age", "ht_in", "wt_lbs", "bmi")
```

```{r}
cat_cols <- c("age_group", "gender", "bmi_4cat", "exposure")
```

#### Repeatedly apply cont_stats_fn

Calculate summary statistics for each of the continuous variables we are interested in. Each time we pass a new variable to `cont_stats_fn` the result will be a data frame of summary statistics for that variable. For now, we will save each of those data frames to a list that we can later reorder and row bind together.

```{r}
stats_list <- cont_cols %>%
  set_names(cont_cols) %>% 
  map(~ cont_stats_fn(study, outcome, !! sym(.x)))
```

#### Repeatedly apply cat_stats_fn

Calculate summary statistics for each of the categorical variables we are interested in. Each time we pass a new variable to `cat_stats_fn` the result will be a data frame of summary statistics for that variable. For now, we will save each of those data frames to a list that we can later reorder and row bind together.

```{r}
stats_list <- c(
  stats_list,
  cat_cols %>%
    set_names(cat_cols) %>% 
    map(~ cat_stats_fn(study, outcome, !! sym(.x)))
)
```

At this point, `stats_list` contains all of our summary statistics of interest as a list of data frames. 

#### Bind together the continuous and categorical summary stats

```{r}
table_1 <- map_dfr(
  .x = c("exposure", "age", "age_group", "gender", "ht_in", "wt_lbs", "bmi", "bmi_4cat"),
  .f = ~ bind_rows(stats_list[[.x]])
) %>% 
print()
```

Remove the final blank row. It makes the Word table look cleaner.

```{r}
table_1 <- slice(table_1, -nrow(table_1))
```

<p class="note"> 🗒**Side Note:** It might be interesting/worthwhile to come back to this at some point and turn everything from in "Step 3. Create a data frame that contains our summary statistics" into a function. </p>

### Step 5. Create flextable

At this point, we have a complete table of summary statistics and it is roughly laid out in the way we want it to be. But, as we discussed above, we don't want to __present__ or __distribute__ summary statistics in the form of an R data frame. The `flextable` package is one awesome tool we can use to transform our data frames of summary statistics into presentation-ready tables for Word, PowerPoint, or HTML documents. The [flextable] chapter gives more details on using the `flextable` package. But, for the sake of completeness, we will go ahead and finish our formatted Table 1.

Technically, the following single function call will turn our Table 1 into a `flextable` object. 

```{r}
table_1_ft <- flextable(table_1)
table_1_ft
```

### Step 6. Formatting flextable

The `flextable` object we created above is a good start; however, we will still want to do some additional formatting before presenting our final table 1 to others. 

<p class="note"> 🗒**Side Note:** We could have done some of this formatting directly in the R data frame, but it's generally a good idea to do formatting in the `flextable` object when possible. </p>

```{r}
table_1_ft <- table_1_ft %>% 
  # Change column widths. figure out through trial and error
  width(width = c(2.5, 2.01, 2.01)) %>% 
  # Center the final two columns
  align(j = c(2, 3), align = "center", part = "all") %>% 
  # Change header names -- add subgroup Ns to headers
  set_header_labels(
    var = "Characteristic",
    No = paste0("No\n(n=", n_outcome["No"], ")"), 
    Yes = paste0("Yes\n(n=", n_outcome["Yes"], ")")
  ) %>% 
  # Bold column headers
  bold(part = "header") %>% 
  # Edit row headers
  compose(i = ~ var == "exposure", j = 1, as_paragraph("Exposure, row percent (95% CI)")) %>% 
  compose(i = ~ var == "age", j = 1, as_paragraph("Age, mean (95% CI)")) %>% 
  compose(i = ~ var == "age_group", j = 1, as_paragraph("Age group, row percent (95% CI)")) %>%
  compose(i = ~ var == "gender", j = 1, as_paragraph("Gender, row percent (95% CI)")) %>% 
  compose(i = ~ var == "ht_in", j = 1, as_paragraph("Height, mean (95% CI)")) %>% 
  compose(i = ~ var == "wt_lbs", j = 1, as_paragraph("Weight, mean (95% CI)")) %>% 
  compose(i = ~ var == "bmi", j = 1, as_paragraph("BMI, mean (95% CI)")) %>% 
  compose(i = ~ var == "bmi_4cat", j = 1, as_paragraph("BMI category, row percent (95% CI)")) %>% 
  # Add footnotes
  footnote(
    i = c(5, 15, 17), j = 1,
    value = as_paragraph(
      c("Age in years.", "Height in inches.", "Weight in pounds.")
    )
  ) %>% 
  # Remove vertical cell padding
  padding(padding.top = 0, padding.bottom = 0, part = "all") %>%
  # Change font to TNR 11
  font(fontname = "Times New Roman", part = "all") %>% 
  fontsize(part = "all", size = 11)
  
table_1_ft
```


### 📝 Load Word template for officer

In general, it seems helpful/expedient to do as much of the prose and formatting as possible directly in the Word template. Then, just add numbers, tables, and graphs from R with bookmarks. 

```{r}
doc <- read_docx("examples/template_descriptive_analysis.docx") %>%
  body_replace_text_at_bkm("date", as.character(Sys.Date())) %>% 
  body_replace_text_at_bkm("n_table_1", as.character(sum(n_outcome))) %>% 
  body_replace_flextable_at_bkm("table_1", table_1_ft)
```


### 📝 Generate Word reports

```{r}
print(
  doc,
  "examples/Example Table 1.docx"
)
```
