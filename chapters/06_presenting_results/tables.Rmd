## ⭐️Overview

This chapter is about formatting and presenting statistical results in tables.

The immediate results of statistical analyses are rarely fit for general consumption. This chapter walks through strategies and functions we can use to make our results ready for presentation/dissemination.

Tables are one of the most popular ways to present information to our audience. When our goal is to show our readers precise numerical summaries of our data, the exact values that resulted from our analysis are important.

However, the specific details that we may want to present from table to table, or the way in which we want to present them, can vary widely. For example, an initial table of descriptive information about our participants may or may not be stratified by subgroups of interest. Additionally, it may include variables of different types, and for any given type, it may include various different kinds of numerical summaries. Further, there are numerous types of inferential models that result in numerical summaries that we may want to present in a table. For these reasons, it is difficult to create a good one-size-fits-all approach to automating the process of making results ready for presentation and dissemination.

Having said that, below we walk through some basic strategies for automating the processes of putting results into presentation-ready summary tables -- and in a way that makes updating them (which happens A LOT) as painless as possible.


## Projects to review and incorporate

stroke study -> table_characteristics_by_network.Rmd to see an example of doing this with purrr::map. When you have time, you should add an example into this document.

See Sun Study Report Template for a good example of automating this with Officer and Flextable.

I used a little different method in Link2Care > paper_smartphone_app > table_use_app.Rmd. Try to work some of that in below. 

/Users/bradcannell/Dropbox/01 Research/Elder Abuse/DETECT NIH RFA-AG-18-010/LEAD Panel/summarise_lead_votes/report_filemaker.Rmd

This chapter also kind of overlaps with the [Flexdashboard] and [Officer] chapters. At some point, I should think about the best way to link and organize the chapters. Another option is to put all the flextable stuff in this chapter. I might still want a separate chapter about officeer.

## 🔢Simulate data 

Have you noticed how we will often calculate the same statistical measures for many different variables in our data? For example, let’s say that we have some pretty standard data about some study participants that looks like this:

```{r}
study <- tibble(
  age       = c(32, 30, 32, 29, 24, 38, 25, 24, 48, 29, 22, 29, 24, 28, 24, 25, 
                25, 22, 25, 24, 25, 24, 23, 24, 31, 24, 29, 24, 22, 23, 26, 23,

# Example: Table 1

This first example is perhaps the most common type of table we will create -- a Table 1 -- or basic descriptive table about our participants. 

Let's start by looking at a complete example: 

[Create a table 1 from the study data and insert a screen shot here]

A typical workflow looks like this...


<!--
Clean up and add session info
-->

# Stuff from 

```{r echo=FALSE}
rm(list = ls())
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
sessionInfo()
```
