## ⭐️Overview

My notes on git and GitHub. There are also chapters in R4Epi on git and GitHub. These notes should not reproduce those chapter. These notes should go beyond those chapters or be used for experimenting. 

* [Coding best practices](https://www.r4epi.com/coding-best-practices.html). I still need to add material to this section about writing commit messages.      
* [Introduction to git and GitHub](https://www.r4epi.com/introduction-to-git-and-github.html)   
* [Using git and GitHub](https://www.r4epi.com/using-git-and-gitHub.html)   

This chapter of the notes still needs a ton of cleaning up!

## Documenting practices

With GitHub, there are so many options for where and how we can document things. This is my current set of best practices.

* README: Getting started and _how_ to use for users.

* Vignettes: More depth than README and possibly talks about the theory behind the package/project. Possibly answers the _why_ questions. 

* Pgkdown: Not different from README and vignettes. Just makes them easier to find and look a little nicer.

* NOTES: My private notes just for me. Not for tasks. Answers _why_ or _how_, but not _what_. When possible, use Wiki instead.

* GitHub Wiki: Public notes for contributors/developers. 

* GitHub Discussion: Public questions and answers. I'm trying to decide if I should just use Stack Overflow somehow instead. Maybe use both.

* GitHub issues: Tasks that need to be completed.

* GitHub projects: Organize issues/tasks.


## Commit message

This section needs a ton of improvement -- and probably should be moved over to [Coding best practices](https://www.r4epi.com/coding-best-practices.html). However, I want to jot down some quick notes.

From, [How to Write a Git Commit Message](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/), I like:

> A properly formed Git commit subject line should always be able to complete the following sentence: If applied, this commit will {your subject line here}


## Pushing commits to remote

> **Don’t push your work until you’re happy with it.** One of the cardinal rules of Git is that, since so much work is local within your clone, you have a great deal of freedom to rewrite your history locally. However, once you push your work, it is a different story entirely, and you should consider pushed work as final unless you have good reason to change it. In short, you should avoid pushing your work until you’re happy with it and ready to share it with the rest of the world. https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History


## Get rid of .DS_Store

The `.DS_Store` file can be an annoyance when working with Git on MacOS. [Here is a link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/107701/how-can-i-remove-ds-store-files-from-a-git-repository/107921) to instructions for removing `.DS_Store` from your repository. Do it early and never worry about it again. 

In the terminal, run the following code from the root directory:

```{bash eval=FALSE}
# Remove existing files from the repository:
find . -name "*.DS_Store" -type f -exec git-rm {} \;
```

```{bash eval=FALSE}
# Add .DS_Store to .gitignore
echo .DS_Store >> .gitignore
```

```{bash eval=FALSE}
# Commit the file to the repo
git add .gitignore
git commit -m '.DS_Store banished!'
```


## Amend

**Changing the last commit:** `git commit --amend`. This is for _adding_ files to the previous commit, not for _removing_ files from the previous commit. 

> The `git commit --amend` command is a convenient way to modify the most recent commit. It lets you combine staged changes with the previous commit instead of creating an entirely new commit. It can also be used to simply edit the previous commit message without changing its snapshot. But, amending does not just alter the most recent commit, it replaces it entirely, meaning the amended commit will be a new entity with its own ref. To Git, it will look like a brand new commit. https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/rewriting-history

* Edit -> commit -> edit -> amend -> commit = no problem!   
* Edit -> commit -> push -> edit -> amend -> commit -> push  = problem!   
* [Short answer, don’t do it.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43289444/git-merge-conflict-after-git-amend-your-branch-and-origin-master-have-diver)     
* [Adding more chages to your last commit](https://medium.com/@igor_marques/git-basics-adding-more-changes-to-your-last-commit-1629344cb9a8)    

## Pull Requests

* [Instructions for leaving comments](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/reviewing-proposed-changes-in-a-pull-request)    
* Very simple merge conflicts can be resolved directly on GitHub.com    
* Use command line instructions to try out the code to resolve more complex merge conflicts.    

Example command line pull request merge conflict
```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/08_collaborating/git_merge_conflict.png")
```

If there are already changes on the branch (so you can’t pull), you need to either:    

* Commit the changes on the branch (if you want to keep them)    
* Throw away local changes with git checkout -f, and then remove untracked files with git clean -fd    

## Branches

Naming convention:
issue-#-short-description

Basic workflow:

1. Create new branch - never develop on Master   
2. Push new branch to remote   
3. Do some work - commit - amend - push along the way    
4. When work is done, create a pull request for Master    
5. Deal with merge conflicts if they exist, and merge into Master    
6. Delete development branch    

[Merging specific files from another branch.](https://jasonrudolph.com/blog/2009/02/25/git-tip-how-to-merge-specific-files-from-another-branch/)

Also, if you haven’t committed the files you don’t want to move over yet:

* Commit just the files you DO want to merge into master.    
* Push    
* Create a request to pull the changes you just committed into the master branch.     
* Don’t delete the issue branch. Just continue working on the files you don’t commit and merge with the pull request.    


## Squashing commits

I've done more of this lately. These notes should be improved too. For now, I just want to jot down that **The first commit message will be the commit message for the squashed commits**. So, if you know you are doing some WIP commits, you may want to start with the end in mind?

You can also [amend your commit message](https://www.gitkraken.com/learn/git/problems/git-commit-amend) in GitKraken, but this is complicated if you've already pushed to a remote repository. 


## Rebase

What is rebase? Like a merge, but leaves a linear commit history.

## Cherry pick

What is cherry pick? Pull one commit from branch A to branch B, without having to bring _all_ commits from branch A to branch B.

## Removing a file

Despite our best efforts, there may be times when we commit a file and push it to GitHub by accident. In that case, it isn't enough to simply gitignore the file. That will prevent future changes to the file from being pushed to GitHub, but it won't do anything about the file that's already there. In fact, you can even delete the file (which you may not actually want to do) and push the deletion to GitHub. But, even in that case, the file will still be in your commit history. So how do you totally banish the file from GitHub as though it was never there in the first place?

1. We have a sandbox repository here: https://github.com/brad-cannell/sandbox. We cloned it to Dropbox/R. 

2. We created a plain text file named `test_git` in the master branch, we added a little bit of text, we committed it to the master branch, and we pushed it to GitHub. 

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/08_collaborating/git_remove_initial_commit.png")
```

3. We created a csv file with some fake "data". We saved it as `data/test_data.csv`. We need the data for our project, but we don't want the data to be pushed to GitHub where it will be available to the public. What we should do is add this file -- or perhaps the entire data folder -- to `.gitignore`. But, we are going to pretend that we forgot to do that. Instead, we committed `data/test_data.csv` to our **local** repo after saving.

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/08_collaborating/git_remove_add_test_data_1.png")
```

In the screenshot above, we can see that we have accidentally committed `data/test_data.csv` to the `master` branch of our local repository. However, we have **not** pushed that commit to our remote repository on GitHub.

### Undo commits, no push

Because we haven't pushed the commit to GitHub, we have lots of options. In fact, we haven't even technically done anything "wrong" yet. Committing the data to our local repository isn't a problem in and of itself. It only becomes a problem when we push it to the public remote repository on GitHub. The easiest solution is to simply click the `Undo` button in GitKraken (https://www.gitkraken.com/learn/git/problems/undo-git-commit). 

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/08_collaborating/git_remove_undo_1.png")
```

As we can see in the screenshot above, clicking `Undo` rolled back the commit, and leaves `data/test_data.csv` in the staging area. Now, we can easily unstage the file `data/test_data.csv`, add it to `.gitignore`, and move on with our project. From this point on, `data/test_data.csv` will still exist on our computer, but git will be totally oblivious to it, and more importantly, won't ever upload a copy of it up to our public remote repository on GitHub. 

This is sort of the best case scenario. Now, let's add one level of complication to the scenario. 

4. Just like 3 above, we committed `data/test_data.csv` to our local repo after saving. However, we don't catch it immediately this time. Instead, we keep working on our project. Specifically, we add a little text to `test_git`, save `test_git`, and commit those changes. Importantly, we still haven't pushed any commits that include `data/test_data.csv` to our public remote repository on GitHub.

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/08_collaborating/git_remove_add_test_data_2.png")
```

It turns out that we can still use the `Undo` button in this scenario as well. 

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/08_collaborating/git_remove_undo_2.png")
```

As we can see in the screenshot above, clicking `Undo` twice rolled back two commits, and left `data/test_data.csv` and the edited version of `test_git` in the staging area. Then, we unstaged `data/test_data.csv`, added it to `.gitignore`, staged the modified `.gitignore`, and committed. From this point on, `data/test_data.csv` will still exist on our computer, but git will be totally oblivious to it, and more importantly, won't ever upload a copy of it up to our public remote repository on GitHub. 

So, when won't the `Undo` button work?

* For starters, it won't work if we've pushed our commit to a remote repository. 

* Additionally, like with undo in Word, once you start clicking undo and then working and then clicking undo again, there is a limit to how far back you can go. I don't fully understand what that limit is at the moment. I think it has something to do with when commit hashes change, or at least when parent hashes changes. Figure this out later. 

I tried all kinds of weird things to make undo _not_ work -- including udoing multiple branches -- and couldn't come up with a case. I know cases exist, but the point is that Undo will work a lot of the time as long as you don't push to a remote repository.

### One commit, pushed to Github

This scenario starts like the one above did.

1. We have a sandbox repository here: https://github.com/brad-cannell/sandbox. We cloned it to Dropbox/R. 

2. We created a plain text file named `test_git` in the master branch, we added a little bit of text, we committed it to the master branch, and we pushed it to GitHub. 

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/08_collaborating/git_remove_initial_commit.png")
```

3. We created a csv file with some fake "data". We saved it as `data/test_data.csv`. We need the data for our project, but we don't want the data to be pushed to GitHub where it will be available to the public. What we should do is add this file -- or perhaps the entire data folder -- to `.gitignore`. But, we are going to pretend that we forgot to do that. Instead, we committed `data/test_data.csv` to our **local** repo after saving.

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/08_collaborating/git_remove_add_test_data_1.png")
```

In the screenshot above, we can see that we have accidentally committed `data/test_data.csv` to the `master` branch of our local repository. However, we have **not** pushed that commit to our remote repository on GitHub.

This time, we do go ahead and push the commit to GitHub.

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/08_collaborating/git_remove_push_1.png")
```

Next, we will click the `Undo` button as we did above. Here's what happens.

* GitKraken gives us a message saying that the undo was successful. 

* The local repository is rolled back to its previous state. 

* `data/test_data.csv` is locally once again in the staging area. 

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/08_collaborating/git_remove_push_2.png")
```

However, when we take a look at the repository in GitHub, we can see that the file is still there. 

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/08_collaborating/git_remove_push_3.png")
```

Our first instinct might be to unstage `data/test_data.csv` locally, add it to `.gitignore`, and then create a new commit with `data/test_data.csv` ignored. Let's do that.

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/08_collaborating/git_remove_push_4.png")
```

However, this hasn't changed anything on GitHub. The data is still available there. So, try to push our commit with `data/test_data.csv` ignored to GitHub.

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/08_collaborating/git_remove_push_5.png")
```

When we do, GitKraken asks us that `refs/heads/master` is behind `refs/remotes/origin/master`. This makes sense, we rolled our local repo back one commit, so it is behind the latest commit on GitHub (i.e., `refs/remotes/origin/master`). However, we are trying to send up a commit that differs from the commit on GitHub. This could create a conflict. So, GitKraken asks us if we want to try to pull down the commit from GitHub first. In this case, we don't. That commit is exactly what we are trying to get rid of. Let's click the `Force Push` button. GitKraken will warn us that this is destructive and double-check that it is what we want to do. It is.

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/08_collaborating/git_remove_push_6.png")
```

Now, when we go on GitHub, we can see that `data/test_data.csv` is not longer showing up in our repository.

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/08_collaborating/git_remove_push_7.png")
```

When we search for `test_data` in our repository, the only place it appears is in the `.gitignore` file. It looks like we successfully removed the data file from our repository!

### Multiple commits, pushed to GitHub

Finally, let's add one more wrinkle to this scenario. Let's send multiple commits to GitHub and see if we can remove any trace of the test data by simply adding it to `.gitignore` and pushing it up to GitHub.

We are going to add some text to `test_git`, commit it to the master branch, and push it to GitHub.

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/08_collaborating/git_remove_mult_push_1.png")
```

Let's once again "accidentally" commit and push a data set -- `data/test_data_2.csv` -- to GitHub.

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/08_collaborating/git_remove_mult_push_2.png")
```

When we look at GitHub, we can see that the file is there.

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/08_collaborating/git_remove_mult_push_3.png")
```

And when we search for test_data_2, it comes up as a commit.

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/08_collaborating/git_remove_mult_push_4.png")
```

If we click on the commit, we can see the data.

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/08_collaborating/git_remove_mult_push_5.png")
```

Now, we will make another change to `test_git`, commit it to the master branch, and push it to GitHub.

We will make a change to `data/test_data_2.csv`, commit it to the master branch, and push it to GitHub.

And, we will make yet another change to `test_git`, commit it to the master branch, and push it to GitHub.

This is what our commit history looks like at this point.

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/08_collaborating/git_remove_mult_push_6.png")
```

Let's once again try to do what we did before. Click the `Undo` button all the way back to our first commit of `data/test_data_2.csv`.

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/08_collaborating/git_remove_mult_push_7.png")
```

Add `data/test_data_2.csv` to `.gitignore`, commit, and force push.

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/08_collaborating/git_remove_mult_push_8.png")
```

Here's the situation:

* The edited `data/test_data_2.csv` file is still on our local machine.

* The edited `test_git` file is still on our local machine, ready to be committed and pushed again.

When we look on GitHub, the data directory is gone.

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/08_collaborating/git_remove_mult_push_9.png")
```

When we search for `test_data` in our repository, the only place it appears is in the `.gitignore` file. 

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/08_collaborating/git_remove_mult_push_10.png")
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/08_collaborating/git_remove_mult_push_11.png")
```

It looks like we successfully removed the data file from our repository!

## Other little quirks and errors

When working on Epi III -- and I think this could be an issue with using git on OneDrive more generally -- I would have to recommit files when I changed computers. Not because the **content** of the file had changed, but because something called the **file mode** had changed. I searched SO and seemed to fix it with this post: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1580596/how-do-i-make-git-ignore-file-mode-chmod-changes

Open terminal and type:

```{bash eval=FALSE}
git config core.fileMode false
```

Another issue I encountered when working on Epi III -- and I think this could be an issue with using git on OneDrive more generally -- was the existence of these "Icon" files every time I switched computers. However, they didn't seem to actually exist (or at least they weren't visible), and ignoring them in the usual way did not seem to _actually_ ignore them. I searched SO and seemed to fix it with this post: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17556250/how-to-ignore-icon-in-git

Open terminal and type:

```{bash eval=FALSE}
printf "Icon\r\r" >> .gitignore
```
