Why create the dev folder?
Sometimes note ideas will come to me while I’m working on a project, but I won’t have time to complete them right at that time. Of course, there are still files in the old R notes folder that need to be moved over to the R Notes bookdown project, but I’m going to put new partial notes in the dev folder.
