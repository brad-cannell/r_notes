[["index.html", "R Notes Welcome Organization", " R Notes Brad Cannell 2022-03-04 Welcome Welcome to Brad Cannell’s R Notes! This is a Bookdown version Brad Cannell’s R Notes. I’m really making this “book” for me, but even better if you find it useful too! Why am I doing this (as opposed to just keeping notes locally)? Better organized (e.g., chapter structure and search) Easy access – just click on the bookmark on web browser Practice using bookdown Might help with R4Epi – This can be sort of a sandbox for developing before I add things to R4Epi. This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License. Organization These notes are loosely organized into the following parts: Programming: Things that have to do with optimizing code, writing functions, creating packages, and repeated operations. Working with external files: Things like data transfer, web scraping, PDF scraping, and using Officer to scrape Microsoft Office documents. Data management: Things related to manipulating/transforming/filtering data that is already in R. Data analysis: Things related to creating numerical summaries of data. Data visualization: Things related to graphical summaries of data. A lot of this will be about ggplot. Presenting results: Things related to making numerical and graphical summaries accessible outside of R. This can include webpages, static dashboards, PDF documents, Microsoft Office documents, ect. This does not include Shiny apps. Shiny: Things related to using Shiny to create interactive web apps. Eventually, this may need its own Bookdown project.

Using packages to create reproducible analyses This is proposed in the Robert Flight’s Blog. I played around with it, but have decided that it’s better to do analysis as a project rather than a package. You can get most of the benefits of this technique - including Git and Packrat - using a project. Just share the entire project folder with a collaborator and / or post on Github. Packages require a bunch of extra work on the front end and are harder to keep up to date. 1.2 🌎Useful websites Hadley Wickham and Jenny Bryan’s R Packages book RStudio Tutorial devtools package usethis package 1.3 Step 1: Create the package project File &gt; New Project New Directory &gt; R Package Give the package a new (Hadley’s naming strategies) If you have R scripts written already, and wish to add them to the package, you can do so using the dialogue box titled “Create package based on source files” Check “Create a git repository” (You can add later) At this point RStudio should automatically open up the Rproj file we just created. Make sure you have the latest version of R, then run the following code to get the packages you’ll need: install.packages(c(&quot;devtools&quot;, &quot;roxygen2&quot;, &quot;testthat&quot;, &quot;knitr&quot;)) Use the following code to access new devtools functions as I develop them. This is particularly important during the development of the book. devtools::install_github(&quot;hadley/devtools&quot;) library(devtools) has_devel() 1.3.1 Step 2: Modify the description file Open the description file and make some changes. Here is an example: Package: freqtables Type: Package Title: Make Quick Descriptive Tables For Categorical Variables Description: Quickly make tables of descriptive statistics (i.e., counts, percentages, confidence intervals) for categorical variables. This package is designed to work in a tidyverse pipeline, and consideration has been given to get results from R to Microsoft Word ® with minimal pain. Version: 0.1.0 Authors@R: person(&quot;Brad&quot;, &quot;Cannell&quot;, email = &quot;brad.cannell@gmail.com&quot;, role = c(&quot;aut&quot;, &quot;cre&quot;)) Maintainer: Brad Cannell &lt;brad.cannell@gmail.com&gt; URL: https://github.com/brad-cannell/freqtables BugReports: https://github.com/brad-cannell/freqtables/issues License: MIT + file LICENSE Encoding: UTF-8 LazyData: true RoxygenNote: 7.0.2 Imports: dplyr Remember that Title Case is required for the Title Do Not use library(package) in R scripts - instead add package dependencies to the Imports or Remotes field in the DESCRIPTION. Do use library(package) in vignette .Rmd files, and do not add these package dependencies to the DESCRIPTION If we added R scripts to the package in Step 1, bullet 4 above, we need to open them now and make sure to remove all the library functions. Note that these R scripts are not linked to the original R scripts. In other words, if I make a change to props.R inside my package, those changes are reflected in the original props.R script. If you use MIT license, remember to add the license file (without file extension) to the main package directory. When adding CRAN packages to imports, you must first make sure they are installed. Instructions for installing dependencies from sources other than CRAN are given here. 1.3.2 Working with R scripts Don’t write or alter your functions in the console as you would in a typical interactive session. If you do, it’s easy for the version you’re using interactively and the version you are actually including in your package to get out of sync. Instead, load the package. Click the build tab &gt; More &gt; Load All, or devtools::load_all, or shift + cmd + L 1.4 Step 3: Writing help pages Help pages are contained in .Rd files saved in the man folder. It’s best practice to use roxygen with your script files to automatically generate the .Rd files. Doing so helps to keep your scripts and your help pages in sync. To use roxygen: Make sure the R script you want to document is active. Click Project Options &gt; Build Tools &gt; Generate documentation with Roxygen Place your cursor in the function you want to document Insert a Roxygen skeleton with the keyboard shortcut cmd + alt + shift + R After you’ve filled in the skeleton click Build &gt; More &gt; Document, or use the keyboard shortcut shift + cmd + D. RStudio will then automatically generate the help pages in your man folder. Click the build tab &gt; More &gt; Load All, or devtools::load_all, or shift + cmd + L Check your help page by typing ?function_name in the console. 1.4.1 Example roxygen header #&#39; @title Compact Table of Summary Statistics #&#39; #&#39; @description Based on Stata&#39;s &quot;tabstat&quot; command. &quot;tabstat displays summary #&#39; statistics for a series of numeric variables in one table. It allows you #&#39; to specify the list of statistics to be displayed. Statistics can be #&#39; calculated (conditioned on) another variable. tabstat allows substantial #&#39; flexibility in terms of the statistics presented and the format of the #&#39; table&quot; (Stata, 2016). #&#39; #&#39; @param x A continuous variable. #&#39; @param digits Rounds the values returned to the specified number of decimal #&#39; places (default 3). #&#39; @param stats Return specified statistics. Options include: #&#39; \\describe{ #&#39; \\item{n}{Count of nonmissing values of x} #&#39; \\item{nmiss}{Count of missing values of x} #&#39; \\item{ci}{95 percent confidence interval for the mean of x} #&#39; \\item{sum}{Sum of x} #&#39; \\item{max}{Maximum value of x} #&#39; \\item{min}{Minimum value of x} #&#39; \\item{range}{(Maximum value of x) - (minimum value of x)} #&#39; \\item{sd}{Standard deviation of x} #&#39; \\item{var}{Variance of x} #&#39; \\item{cv}{Coefficient of variation (sd / mean) of x} #&#39; \\item{sem}{Standard error of the mean of x} #&#39; \\item{skew}{Skewness of x} #&#39; \\item{kurt}{Kurtosis of x} #&#39; \\item{p1}{1st percentile of x} #&#39; \\item{p5}{5th percentile of x} #&#39; \\item{p10}{10th percentile of x} #&#39; \\item{p25}{25th percentile of x} #&#39; \\item{p50}{Median value of x} #&#39; \\item{median}{Median value of x} #&#39; \\item{p75}{75th percentile of x} #&#39; \\item{p90}{90th percentile of x} #&#39; \\item{p95}{95th percentile of x} #&#39; \\item{p99}{99th percentile of x} #&#39; \\item{iqr}{Interquartile range (p75 - p25)} #&#39; \\item{q}{Equivalent to specifying p25 p50 p75} #&#39; } #&#39; #&#39; @return A data frame. By default, the data frame contains the variable name #&#39; and mean. #&#39; @export #&#39; #&#39; @references Stata 14 help for tabstat #&#39; \\url{http://www.stata.com/help.cgi?tabstat} #&#39; #&#39; @examples #&#39; data(mtcars) #&#39; #&#39; # Single univariate analysis with Defaults #&#39; tabstat(mtcars$mpg) #&#39; #&#39; # Single univariate analysis with all stats #&#39; tabstat(mtcars$mpg, stats = c(&quot;n&quot;, &quot;nmiss&quot;, &quot;ci&quot;, &quot;sum&quot;, &quot;max&quot;, &quot;min&quot;, #&#39; &quot;range&quot;, &quot;sd&quot;, &quot;var&quot;, &quot;cv&quot;, &quot;sem&quot;, &quot;skew&quot;, &quot;kurt&quot;, &quot;p1&quot;, &quot;p5&quot;, &quot;p10&quot;, #&#39; &quot;p25&quot;, &quot;p50&quot;, &quot;median&quot;, &quot;p75&quot;, &quot;p90&quot;, &quot;p95&quot;, &quot;p99&quot;, &quot;iqr&quot;, &quot;q&quot;)) 1.4.2 Don’t run the examples If you don’t want the examples to actually run, You can surround the example code with like this: #&#39; @examples #&#39; \\dontrun{ #&#39; library(dplyr) #&#39; library(meantables) #&#39; #&#39; data(mtcars) #&#39; #&#39; # Overall mean table with defaults #&#39; #&#39; mtcars %&gt;% #&#39; mean_table(mpg) #&#39; #&#39; # A tibble: 1 x 9 #&#39; response_var n mean sd sem lcl ucl min max #&#39; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; #&#39; 1 mpg 32 20.1 6.03 1.07 17.9 22.3 10.4 33.9 #&#39; } 1.4.3 Keyboard shortcut for inserting roxygen #’ comment There doesn’t appear to be a keyboard shortcut, but this StackOverflow post shows a good method for using RStudio’s find and replace. 1.4.4 Documenting Package: You can use roxygen to provide a help page for your package as a whole. More information is available from Hadley here. At this point, you have a usable package 1.4.5 Once package is complete (ish) Update documentation (help pages). Build &gt; More &gt; Document, or shift + cmd + D. Check the package by clicking Build &gt; Check. This will look for common package problems Click Build &gt; Build &amp; Reload. That will build the package and install it in your local package directory If you want to copy the package to send to someone else, click Build &gt; More &gt; Build source package. RStudio will build the package and save it as a .tar.gz file. You can then send it to another user to be installed on their system. If you are using GitHub, you need to commit changes and then push them to GitHub. More information about using Git and GitHub are available here. Other users can install your package directly from GitHub with install.packages(\"devtools\") followed by devtools::install_github(\"username/packagename\"). 1.4.6 Notes about package notes: Because packages are almost always a work in progress, you will want to add notes to yourself about the project in the source package that you don’t want others to see. You can do this by creating a notes directory, and then listing that directory in .Rbuildignore. You can add to buildignore using usethis::use_build_ignore(\"notes\"). More information is available here. Also make sure to add NOTES to .gitignore with usethis::use_git_ignore(\"notes\") Use NOTES for notes, but not tasks. Why or how, but not what. Tasks go into issues. There is a NOTES template in R/Templates. 1.5 Step 4: Synchronize with GitHub Again, details are available in Hadley Wickham’s Book. Note: to exculde files from add them to .gitignore manually, or by clicking Git &gt; More &gt; Ignore. If you didn’t check “Create a git repository” in step 1, you’ll need to create one now. Do so by clicking Project Options &gt; Git/SVN &gt; Version Control System. May need to restart R Create a README.md file (devtools::use_readme_rmd()) Note: This only works if you set up the project as a package. Do this, even if you don’t intend to create a package. There are just nice extra tools avaialable when you select project type &gt; R Package. Create a new repo on GitHub: https://github.com/new. Give it the same name as your package, and include the package title as the repo description. Leave all the other options as is, then click Submit. Open a shell, then type git remote add origin https://github.com/mbcann01/dataclean.git Modify DESCRIPTION to add URL and BugReports fields that link to your new GitHub site. Save the file and commit (with the message “Updating DESCRIPTION to add links to GitHub site”) Open a shell, then type git push -u origin master Enter username mbcann01 and password asdf1234 Go to your GitHub page and look at the DESCRIPTION 1.5.1 Get rid of .DS_Store The .DS_Store file can be an annoyance when working with Git on MacOS. Here is a link to instructions for removing .DS_Store from your repository. Do it early and never worry about it again. In the terminal, run the following code from the root directory: # Remove existing files from the repository: find . -name &quot;*.DS_Store&quot; -type f -exec git-rm {} \\; # Add .DS_Store to .gitignore echo .DS_Store &gt;&gt; .gitignore # Commit the file to the repo git add .gitignore git commit -m &#39;.DS_Store banished!&#39; 1.5.2 Example: Modify Description URL: https://github.com/mbcann01/dataclean BugReports: https://github.com/mbcann01/dataclean/issues 1.5.3 Example Installation instructions for README: All files can be viewed directly on Github. To install this package locally, simply use devtools: library(devtools) devtools::install_github(&quot;mbcann01/detectPilotTest&quot;) library(detectPilotTest) browseVignettes(&quot;detectPilotTest&quot;) 1.6 Step 5: Testing Testing is an important part of programming. For detailed information on testing see the appropriate chapter in Hadley Wickham’s Book. Further guidance is available at the R Journal. Get started with devtools::use_testthat(). Create test file. Must be in tests/testhat. File name should start with test_ and the function name. For example, test_check_catvars. Modify your code or tests Test your package with Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + T or devtools::test(). Repeat until all tests pass. 1.7 Vignettes There are some great vignette resources on the internet: Chapter on vignettes in Hadley’s Package book Leisch’s creating R packages tutorial Flight’s article on creating an analysis as a package and vignette 1.7.1 To create a vignette: run usethis::use_vignette(\"my-vignette\") Open vignettes/my-vignette.Rmd Create the vignette Unlike R scripts, install and load packages directly in the vignettes. Knit the vignette - The default action will be to create a version of the vignette that can be viewed in RStudio. However, devtools::install_github() (and friends) will not build vignettes by default because they’re time consuming and may require additional packages. So, in order to be able to view the vignette in RStudio, you must use vignettes = TRUE, e.g., devtools::install_github(“brad-cannell/bfuncs,” build_vignettes = TRUE) instead. Use devtools::build_vignettes() to create an html version of the vignette in inst/doc that you can provide a link to on your Github README page. By default, these folders will be added to .gitignore. Remove them from .gitignore to be able to view/use them on Github. Create a rawgit version of the html vignette file, and providea link to it on README. use use devtools::build() to create a package bundle with the vignettes included. RStudio’s “Build &amp; reload” does not build vignettes to save time. When you add or update vignettes, push to Github again. 1.7.2 Vignette Notes: This builds the vignettes, and is probably fine for a regular package of functions. However, when using packages as a means for reproducible, self-contained analysis projects, the vignettes have greater importance, and by default are not easily accessible. Need to find a way to make the vignettes more “front and center” Create a help page for the entire package that includes links to the vignettes? Include links to the README.md file and upload to GitHub (with the data sets excluded)? Remember to use system.file() when reading in data inside a code chunk. If you have trouble getting it to work, try build &amp; reload. To save a data frame to data/ inside a vignette, you can use the rprojroot package. use rprojroot::find_root(\"DESCRIPTION\") 1.8 Adding and documenting data The explanation in the R Packages book is good, short, and easy to follow. 1.9 Errors, warnings, notes Below are some common errors, warnings and notes I’ve encountered during build tests. W checking for unstated dependencies in examples … ‘library’ or ‘require’ call not declared from: ‘tidyverse’ E checking examples (707ms) Running examples in ‘freqtables-Ex.R’ failed The error most likely occurred in: I got this error because I had library(tidyverse) in theexamples? section of my roxygen2 header in one of my R scripts, but I did not have tidyverse in the Imports section of my DESCRIPTION file. I could add tidyverse to the DESCRIPTION file (usethis::use_package(\"tidyverse\", type = \"Imports\")). However, in this case I chose to use library(dplyr), which was already in the Imports section of my DESCRIPTION file, instead. W checking dependencies in R code (369ms) ‘::’ or ‘:::’ import not declared from: ‘rlang’ To fix this one simply run the following code in the console: usethis::use_package(\"rlang\", type = \"Imports\") Warning: ‘inst/doc’ files … ignored as vignettes have been rebuilt. Just ignore this one. Warning in strptime(xx, f &lt;- “%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%OS,” tz = tz) : unknown timezone ‘zone/tz/2017c.1.0/zoneinfo/America/Chicago’ Just ingnore this one. It’s a problem with my computer, not with the package code. Non-standard files/directories found at top level: ‘develop_test_table.Rmd’ ‘develop_test_table.nb.html’ Need to delete these files when I’m done developing chi-square test. Prevents R CMD check: “no visible binding for global variable ‘.’” Put the following (for example) directly inside the function definition in the R script where the function is defined: # ------------------------------------------------------------------ # Prevents R CMD check: &quot;no visible binding for global variable ‘.’&quot; # ------------------------------------------------------------------ n = n_total = prop = t_crit = se = lcl_wald = ucl_wald = percent = NULL N checking R code for possible problems (1.8s) get_group_n: no visible global function definition for ‘%&gt;%’ Undefined global functions or variables: %&gt;% Info on fixing this issue Short answer: Add the following directly inside the roxygen2 header in the R script where the function is defined: @importFrom dplyr %&gt;%. You must also make sure that it gets to the NAMESPACE. Run usethis::use_namespace() and then devtools::document() to get it into NAMESPACE.

In RStudio, click on the “new file” button. Click “R Markdown…” Click “From Template” in the left sidebar menu. A list of Rmd templates appears in the “Template:” list. You can create your own templates and add them to this menu, which can be really handy! Below, I describe how to do that. Important: Rmd templates can only be added to RStudio’s template list by adding the Rmd template to a package and then installing that package on your computer. Read Hadley Wickham and Jenny Bryan’s R Packages book for an overview of creating R packages. 2.2 🌎Useful websites https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/document-templates.html https://r-pkgs.org/ 2.3 Create a package See R Packages and/or my R packages notes. 2.4 Add a template to your package Step 1. Create directory for template Templates are located within the inst/rmarkdown/templates directory of a package. This structure can be generated automatically with the use_rmarkdown_template() function from the usethis package. It is possible to contain multiple templates in a single package, with each template stored in a separate sub-directory. Step 2. For example, the “No Output” Rmd template can be viewed at: https://github.com/brad-cannell/templates/blob/master/inst/rmarkdown/templates/no_output/skeleton/skeleton.Rmd Step 3. Change the name of the folder in inst/rmarkdown/templates from template-name. For example, no_output. Step 4. Open the folder you just renamed and update template.yaml. The value you pass to the name: parameter will determine how the template is listed in RStudio’s template list. For example, name: No Output. The value you pass to the description: parameter appear as a tool tip when you hover your mouse over the template’s name in RStudio’s template list. For, example, Brad Cannell's template for an Rmd file with no output. Step 5. Create (or copy and paste) your Rmd template file into skeleton/skeleton.Rmd. 🗒Side Note: If you already have a template in your package, you can create another one by pasting usethis::use_rmarkdown_template() in the console again and following the steps above.

Tidy Eval is all about quoting. Not in the \"\" sense, which is to create a character string. Rather, Quoting is the action of capturing an expression instead of evaluating it. This is similar to the way formulas work in R. For example: # Computing the value of the expression: toupper(letters[1:5]) ## [1] &quot;A&quot; &quot;B&quot; &quot;C&quot; &quot;D&quot; &quot;E&quot; # Capturing the expression: quote(toupper(letters[1:5])) ## toupper(letters[1:5]) Don’t forget: When using quoted expressions, or quotures inside functions, you must unquote them where you want the expression evaluated. You can unquote with !! or unquote-splice with !!!. You can also use the curly-curly syntax to unquote: {{}}. I’m still not clear on when to use one vs. the other. 3.6 Key Functions .data pronoun Not officially part of Tidy Eval (part of rlang). However, useful to keep in mind in situations where you might be programming over multiple data frames. If you’re in that situation, go check out the Pragramming with dplyr link above for more details. quo() This is sort of the foundational function in Tidy Eval. It creates a class quoture object, which is a special type of formula. quo() captures expressions when outside of user-defined functions. # What does quo() return? quo(species) # Where species is a variable in the Starwars tibble ## &lt;quosure&gt; ## expr: ^species ## env: global # Basic usage of quo() in function freq_table &lt;- function(df, x, ...) { df %&gt;% # No quoting and unquoting necessary for the tibble group_by(!!x) %&gt;% # Don&#39;t forget to unquote (!!) where you want the quoture evaluated summarise(N = n()) %&gt;% # Calculate freq top_n(3, N) # Return top 3 results } freq_table(df = starwars, x = quo(species)) ## # A tibble: 3 × 2 ## species N ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 Droid 6 ## 2 Human 35 ## 3 &lt;NA&gt; 4 enquo() If you don’t want the user of your function to be able to pass the variable name as an argument without wrapping in quo(), that’s where enquo() comes in. # Basic usage of enquo() in function freq_table &lt;- function(df, x, ...) { x &lt;- enquo(x) # Capturing function argument and turning it into a quoture df %&gt;% group_by(!!x) %&gt;% summarise(N = n()) %&gt;% top_n(3, N) } freq_table(df = starwars, x = species) # Notice we no longer need to wrop species with quo() ## # A tibble: 3 × 2 ## species N ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 Droid 6 ## 2 Human 35 ## 3 &lt;NA&gt; 4 quos() Use quos() with ... when you want to pass multiple variables / arguments / expressions into your function.

I think if I could understand the contrived situation below, then I could figure out my issue. Essentially, when I use map(x, function(x) { !!x }) with tidyeval I get the result that I expect. When I try to use the purrr shortcut, i.e., map(x, ~ { !!. }) I get an error. I don’t understand why. If anybody has insight that they care to share, I would really appreciate it! A reprex is below: This works as expected: vars &lt;- quos(gender, species) map_df(vars, function(x){ starwars %&gt;% group_by(!! x) %&gt;% summarise(mean(height, na.rm = TRUE)) }) ## # A tibble: 41 × 3 ## gender `mean(height, na.rm = TRUE)` species ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 feminine 165. &lt;NA&gt; ## 2 masculine 177. &lt;NA&gt; ## 3 &lt;NA&gt; 181. &lt;NA&gt; ## 4 &lt;NA&gt; 79 Aleena ## 5 &lt;NA&gt; 198 Besalisk ## 6 &lt;NA&gt; 198 Cerean ## 7 &lt;NA&gt; 196 Chagrian ## 8 &lt;NA&gt; 168 Clawdite ## 9 &lt;NA&gt; 131.

At this point, I’m not exactly sure the rules related to when it works and when it doesn’t work, but I do want to write down some examples and fixes. Sometimes it’s my fault: example &lt;- function(df, var, ...) { x &lt;- enquo(var) print(!!x) # This doesn&#39;t work - need to associate the quoture variable with its data frame } starwars %&gt;% example(hair_color) ## Error: Quosures can only be unquoted within a quasiquotation context. ## ## # Bad: ## list(!!myquosure) ## ## # Good: ## dplyr::mutate(data, !!myquosure) Fix: example &lt;- function(df, var, ...) { x &lt;- enquo(var) df %&gt;% select(!!x) %&gt;% print() } starwars %&gt;% example(hair_color) ## # A tibble: 87 × 1 ## hair_color ## &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 blond ## 2 &lt;NA&gt; ## 3 &lt;NA&gt; ## 4 none ## 5 brown ## 6 brown, grey ## 7 brown ## 8 &lt;NA&gt; ## 9 black ## 10 auburn, white ## # … with 77 more rows 3.10.2 Unquoting inside non-dplyr functions I’ve notice some weirdness when trying to unquote quotures inside functions that are inside dplyr functions.

"],["arranging-columns-with-across.html", "4 Arranging Columns with Across 4.1 Solution by LMc:", " 4 Arranging Columns with Across I’m trying to arrange calculated columns immediately after source columns when using dplyr column-wise operations. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67076974/arrange-calculated-columns-immediately-after-source-columns-when-using-dplyr-col/67077122#67077122 https://community.rstudio.com/t/arrange-calculated-columns-immediately-after-source-columns-when-using-dplyr-column-wise-operations/101726 library(dplyr) Example data df &lt;- tibble( id = c(1, 2, 2), id_row = c(1, 1, 2), name_first = c(&quot;John&quot;, &quot;Jane&quot;, &quot;Jane&quot;), city = c(&quot;NY&quot;, &quot;DAL&quot;, &quot;HOU&quot;), x = c(0, 1, 0) ) df ## # A tibble: 3 × 5 ## id id_row name_first city x ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1 1 John NY 0 ## 2 2 1 Jane DAL 1 ## 3 2 2 Jane HOU 0 Within ID, the values of name_first and city should be constant. The values for id_row and x need not be constant. I want to test for and inspect differing values of name_first and city within-id. One convenient way to do this is with mutate() and across(). df %&gt;% group_by(id) %&gt;% mutate( across( .cols = c(name_first, city), .fns = ~ length(unique(.x)) == 1, .names = &quot;{col}_all_match&quot; ) ) ## # A tibble: 3 × 7 ## # Groups: id [2] ## id id_row name_first city x name_first_all_match city_all_match ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; ## 1 1 1 John NY 0 TRUE TRUE ## 2 2 1 Jane DAL 1 TRUE FALSE ## 3 2 2 Jane HOU 0 TRUE FALSE The issue is that the “all_match” (calculated) columns are added to the far right of the data frame rather than immediately after their source column. This makes it difficult to visually inspect differing values for the columns of interest. Of course, in this small data frame, we could easily rearrange the columns using select(). df %&gt;% group_by(id) %&gt;% mutate( across( .cols = c(name_first, city), .fns = ~ length(unique(.x)) == 1, .names = &quot;{col}_all_match&quot; ) ) %&gt;% select(id, id_row, starts_with(&quot;name_first&quot;), starts_with(&quot;city&quot;), x) ## # A tibble: 3 × 7 ## # Groups: id [2] ## id id_row name_first name_first_all_match city city_all_match x ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1 1 John TRUE NY TRUE 0 ## 2 2 1 Jane TRUE DAL FALSE 1 ## 3 2 2 Jane TRUE HOU FALSE 0 The issue with that approach is that it quickly becomes pretty cumbersome with more columns. A more tractable approach would be to sort the names alphabetically… df %&gt;% group_by(id) %&gt;% mutate( across( .cols = c(name_first, city), .fns = ~ length(unique(.x)) == 1, .names = &quot;{col}_all_match&quot; ) ) %&gt;% select(sort(names(.))) ## # A tibble: 3 × 7 ## # Groups: id [2] ## city city_all_match id id_row name_first name_first_all_match x ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;lgl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 NY TRUE 1 1 John TRUE 0 ## 2 DAL FALSE 2 1 Jane TRUE 1 ## 3 HOU FALSE 2 2 Jane TRUE 0 …but in my situation I need to preserve the original column order.

All of the QDS files (plus some other files) needed to be merged together into a final analysis data set. However, not all questions were asked at all visits and column names were inconsistently used across visits. Even when the names were almost the same, a visit number was attached to the name (e.g., TODAY_V1, TODAY_V2, TODAY_V3, etc.). Finally, each data set contained 800+ columns, which made renaming them all manually tedious and error prone. So, I’m trying to come up with a better way. One method I came up with was reading in the variable names from the Word codebooks and then modifying them. Using this method required making some custom styles in Word and applying those styles to the column names. This seemed to work pretty well at first, but then Joe and James made some changes to QDS, which rendered the codebooks I’d made all the changes to obsolete. This left me with two options: Have some of the variable name adjustments pulled from the codebook and some of the variable name adjustments done manually in the R code (e.g., T26, visit type). Keep all of the adjustments in the codebook, which means converting the new codebooks to word documents, and going back through them to format all of the old column names again. Neither of these options seems very robust or future-proof. While it might be a lot of work upfront, I’m starting to think that just doing all of the variable renaming in the R code might be the way to go. Below, I’m going to play around with how to automate as much of this process as possible. 5.2 🌎Useful websites GitHub issue R4Epi rename_with exampe rename_with documentation Getting your data into R from Google Sheets RStudio Community: Rename with a named vector/list and contribution to the tidyverse 5.3 📦Load packages library(dplyr) library(stringr) library(testthat) library(tidyr) library(purrr) library(googlesheets4) 5.4 🔢Simulate data Simulate 3 QDS data sets. Don’t worry about the values much. They really aren’t the issue for this example. SUBJECT: No change in column name across visits. TODAY_V and VISIT_V: The _V1, _V2, _V3 part changes. SQ_2: Only exists in v1, and the name is altered. GROUP: Only exists in v3. WEIGHT and WEIGHT3: Doesn’t exist in v2 and doesn’t follow any naming convention. DEMO16G and DEM14GV3: The variable was named incorrectly in v1. DS10A_V2: Only asked in v2 and doesn’t follow typical naming convention. DEM15V1: Only asked in v1 and I want to change the name completely. T26A_V1: Only exists in v1 and v3. Also, it needs to be renamed. T26A_V1A and T26A_V1B: Only exists in v1 and v3. Needs to be renamed, and it requires using the dummy variable naming convention. T31_V1B, T31_V3B, T31B_V1, and T31B_V3: Added these later. In v1, v3, v4, and v5 there is a column named T31B_V1 and a column named T31_V1B. The standardize_col_names() function converts both of these to t_31b, which causes rename_with() to throw an error. Further, I can’t just manually change it to t33 (what it will ultimately end up being named) before I run standardize_col_names() because then in conflicts with T33_V1. I need to find a solution inside of the standardize_col_names() function. Additionally, we want to convert all column names to lower case and follow these naming conventions: The typical way that variables are named in these data sets is: [optionally:dummy_variable_lettered] For example: BPM1_V1, LSN3_V1 _[optionally:dummy_variable_lettered] For example: Screening Question 2 is named: SQ_2 OR: The dummy variable for the “EMAIL” Response to Screening Question 18 is: SQ_18A Many questions also have the visit number embedded in the name. For example: Demographics question 1 is: DEM1V1. However, there are some exceptions to this rule - intentional or not. For example, the fifth MMSE question is: MMS4V In order to improve consistency in the variable names, we will adopt the following convention: _[optionally:dummy_variable_lettered] dummy variables will be numbered a-z For example, sq_12, t_14a We will drop visit number from the variable name an use an explicit visit variable. Exceptions: Demographic variables that almost anyone should be reasonably able to understand without the codebook will be given intuitive, descriptive names (e.g., age, race, gender, marital_status, etc.).

First, only make the changes to the individual data frames that will affect the merge (e.g., weight and weight_3). After the merge, we will make changes to column names that need to be changed in multiple data frames (e.g., t_26a). By doing this after the merge, it reduces code repetition and reduces the risk of typos in the column names. # demo_16g was incorrectly numbered when the data was created v1 &lt;- rename(v1, dem_14g = demo_16g) # weight_3 was missing a &quot;v&quot; when it was created in the data frame v3 &lt;- rename(v3, weight = weight_3) 5.15.3 Merge all 3 visits Merge all 3 visits into a single data frame qds_all_visits &lt;- v1 %&gt;% bind_rows(v2) %&gt;% bind_rows(v3) %&gt;% arrange(subject, visit) DT::datatable(qds_all_visits, options = list(scrollX = TRUE)) 5.15.4 Manual changes to column names 2 We already made changes to the individual data frames that would have affected the merge (e.g., weight and weight_3). Now, we will make changes to column names that need to be changed in multiple data frames (e.g., t_26a). qds_all_visits &lt;- qds_all_visits %&gt;% rename( id = subject, date_visit = today, sq_hispanic = sq_2, dem_veteran = dem_15 ) %&gt;% # Take the extra &quot;a&quot; out of all the T26 col names rename_with( ~ str_replace(.x, &quot;t_26a&quot;, &quot;t_26&quot;) ) %&gt;% # Combine T31B_V1 and T31B_V3 as t_33 # Combine T32B_V1 and T32B_V3 as t_34 mutate( t_33 = if_else(is.na(T31B_V1), T31B_V3, T31B_V1), t_34 = if_else(is.na(T32B_V1), T32B_V3, T32B_V1) ) %&gt;% select(-T31B_V1, -T31B_V3, -T32B_V1, -T32B_V3) DT::datatable(qds_all_visits, options = list(scrollX = TRUE)) 5.15.5 Final data cleaning Carry forward time-invariant variables qds_all_visits %&gt;% # Carry forward time-invariant variables group_by(id) %&gt;% fill(sq_hispanic, dem_veteran, group, .direction = &quot;downup&quot;) %&gt;% ungroup %&gt;% DT::datatable(options = list(scrollX = TRUE)) 5.16 🟢 Making a key in Google Sheets Why might I want to do this in the first place? Pros: Everyone can use Excel. Not everyone is comfortable using RStudio. So, people other than me may be intimidated if they need to look up the changes to the column names by opening an Rmd file in RStudio. If I need to look up changes to column names, it may be faster to do so in Excel. Cons: Creating the Excel sheet may be an additional layer of work. This process creates additional documents (i.e., other than the Rmd files) to keep track of and update. However, if ALL of the updates to column names go in this spreadsheet, then it should really be the only one that requires tracking and updating. Hard to use versioning for Excel. Why use Google Sheets instead of Excel? It has all of the pros above, plus versioning. Also, Google Sheets makes it easy to use regular expressions, which I’ve found useful in the past. # Clean up environment first rm(list = ls()) v1 &lt;- tibble( SUBJECT = c(2001, 2002), TODAY_V1 = as.Date(c(&quot;2018-04-07&quot;, &quot;2018-05-03&quot;)), VISIT_V1 = 1, SQ_2 = c(1, 0), WEIGHT = c(179, 194), DEMO16G = c(0, 1), DEM15V1 = c(1, 0), T26A_V1 = c(2, 4), T26A_V1A = c(0, 0), T26A_V1B = c(1, 0), T31_V1B = c(0, 0), T31B_V1 = c(0, 0), # Making these up to test standardize_col_names when more than one duplicate # column name would be created. T32_V1B = c(1, 1), T32B_V1 = c(1, 1) ) v2 &lt;- tibble( SUBJECT = c(2001, 2002), TODAY_V2 = as.Date(c(&quot;2018-04-30&quot;, &quot;2018-05-07&quot;)), VISIT_V2 = 2 ) v3 &lt;- tibble( SUBJECT = c(2001, 2002), TODAY_V3 = as.Date(c(&quot;2018-05-31&quot;, &quot;2018-06-08&quot;)), VISIT_V3 = 3, GROUP = c(1, 2), WEIGHT3 = c(179, 194), DEM14GV3 = c(2, 3), T26A_V3 = c(2, 4), T26A_V3A = c(0, 0), T26A_V3B = c(1, 0), T31_V3B = c(0, 0), T31B_V3 = c(0, 0), # Making these up to test standardize_col_names when more than one duplicate T32_V3B = c(1, 1), T32B_V3 = c(1, 1) ) 5.16.1 Create the Google Sheet column name key NOTE: You should only have to do this once. After you create the initial spreadsheet, all future changes to column names should occur directly in the spreadsheet. Create a new Google sheet. Name it. Rename the first sheet “visit1.” Name column A old_name and column B new_name. Create a character string of existing column names that you can copy and paste into the old_name column of the Google Sheet. names(v1) %&gt;% paste(collapse = &quot;\\n&quot;) %&gt;% cat() ## SUBJECT ## TODAY_V1 ## VISIT_V1 ## SQ_2 ## WEIGHT ## DEMO16G ## DEM15V1 ## T26A_V1 ## T26A_V1A ## T26A_V1B ## T31_V1B ## T31B_V1 ## T32_V1B ## T32B_V1 You can directly type new names into the new_name column. Or, you can use regular expressions in steps similar to what the standardize_col_names() function we created above does: Move new_name to column E Name column B lower and type the following function into B2: =LOWER(A2). Paste the formula down. Name column C remove_v1 and type the following function into C2: =REGEXREPLACE(B2, \"v1|_v1\", \"\"). Paste the formula down. Name column D add_underscore and type the following function into D2: =REGEXREPLACE(C2,\"([a-z])(\\d)\", \"$1_$2\"). Paste the formula down. Notice that Google Sheets uses $1 instead of \\\\1 for replacing with a capture group. Make final edits in the new_name column. 5.16.2 Import the Google Sheet column name key The first time you attempt to read-in a Google Sheet you will need to authenticate your Google user name and password.

A slightly more complex, but safer, way to do this is with rename(). Using new_name = old_name inside the rename function make it less likely to accidentally assign the wrong new_name to a column. 5.16.3.1 Create a named vector Create a named vector of old names and new names that you can pass to select() or rename(). rename_vector &lt;- gs_col_name_key$old_name names(rename_vector) &lt;- gs_col_name_key$new_name rename_vector ## id date_visit visit sq_hispanic weight dem_14g ## &quot;SUBJECT&quot; &quot;TODAY_V1&quot; &quot;VISIT_V1&quot; &quot;SQ_2&quot; &quot;WEIGHT&quot; &quot;DEMO16G&quot; ## dem_veteran t_26 t_26a t_26b t_31b t_33 ## &quot;DEM15V1&quot; &quot;T26A_V1&quot; &quot;T26A_V1A&quot; &quot;T26A_V1B&quot; &quot;T31_V1B&quot; &quot;T31B_V1&quot; ## t_32b t_34 ## &quot;T32_V1B&quot; &quot;T32B_V1&quot; 5.16.3.2 Reorder and rename the current data frame Reorder and rename the current data frame using rename_vector. v1 %&gt;% select(!!! rename_vector) %&gt;% DT::datatable(options = list(scrollX = TRUE)) 5.16.3.3 More columns in df than Sheet What if there are columns in the data frame that haven’t yet been added to the Google Sheet? v1 %&gt;% rowwise() %&gt;% mutate(T_Total = sum(c_across(T26A_V1:T32B_V1))) %&gt;% ungroup() %&gt;% rename(!!! rename_vector) %&gt;% DT::datatable(options = list(scrollX = TRUE)) It just leaves the extra column’s name unchanged, which is exactly what we want. 5.16.3.4 More columns in Sheet and df What if there are columns in the Google Sheet that aren’t in the data frame? rename_vector_2 &lt;- c(rename_vector, &quot;mms_1&quot; = &quot;MMS1&quot;) v1 %&gt;% rename(!!! rename_vector_2) %&gt;% DT::datatable(options = list(scrollX = TRUE)) ## Error: Can&#39;t rename columns that don&#39;t exist. ## x Column `MMS1` doesn&#39;t exist.

Data Summary Consider the following example regarding the management of Hodgkin lymphoma, a cancer of the lymphatic system. Years ago when a patient was diagnosed with Hodgkin Disease, they would frequently undergo a surgical procedure called a “staging laparotomy.” The purpose of the staging laparotomy was to determine the extent to which the cancer had spread, because this was important information for determining the patient’s prognosis and optimizing treatment. At times, the surgeons performing this procedure would also remove the patient’s appendix, not because it was inflamed; it was done “incidentally” in order to ensure that the patient never had to worry about getting appendicitis. However, performing an appendectomy requires transecting it, and this has the potential to contaminate the abdomen and the wound edges with bacteria normally contained inside the appendix. Some surgeons felt that doing this “incidental appendectomy” did the patient a favor by ensuring that they would never get appendicitis, but others felt that it meant unnecessarily increasing the patient’s risk of getting a post-operative wound infection by spreading around the bacteria that was once inside the appendix. To address this, the surgeons at a large hospital performed a retrospective cohort study. They began by going through the hospital’s medical records to identify all subjects who had had a “staging laparotomy performed for Hodgkin.” They then reviewed the medical record and looked at the operative report to determine whether the patient had an incidental appendectomy or not. They then reviewed the progress notes, the laboratory reports, the nurses notes, and the discharge summary to determine whether the patient had developed a wound infection during the week after surgery. The investigators reviewed the records of 210 patients who had undergone the staging procedure and found that 131 had also had an incidental appendectomy, while the other 79 had not. The data from that study are summarized in the table below. The numbers in the second and third columns indicate the number of subjects who did or did not develop a post-operative wound infection among those who had the incidental appendectomy (in the “Yes” row) and those who did not have the incidental appendectomy (in the “No” row). For example, the upper left cell indicates that seven of the subjects who had an incidental appendectomy (the exposure of interest) subsequently developed a wound infection. The upper right cell indicates that the other 124 subjects who had an incidental appendectomy did NOT develop a wound infection. Had incidental appendectomy? Wound infection No wound infection Total Yes 7 124 131 No 1 78 79 Total 8 202 210 6.5 Manually create data First, we can manually create tibble with one row for each person represented in the data above. Ordinarily, this is how the data would come to us. Then, we can use various different techniques – some of which are demonstrated below – to summarize the data as a 2x2 contingency table. In this case, we are working backwards from the data summary to the raw data just to show one way that it can be done. This isn’t necessarily a good way to do it, however. Later, we will demonstrate more efficient and less error-prone ways to create raw data from summary tables. df &lt;- tibble( appendectomy = factor(c(rep(&quot;Yes&quot;, 7), rep(&quot;Yes&quot;, 124), &quot;No&quot;, rep(&quot;No&quot;, 78))), infection = factor(c(rep(&quot;Yes&quot;, 7), rep(&quot;No&quot;, 124), &quot;Yes&quot;, rep(&quot;No&quot;, 78))) ) df ## # A tibble: 210 × 2 ## appendectomy infection ## &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt; ## 1 Yes Yes ## 2 Yes Yes ## 3 Yes Yes ## 4 Yes Yes ## 5 Yes Yes ## 6 Yes Yes ## 7 Yes Yes ## 8 Yes No ## 9 Yes No ## 10 Yes No ## # … with 200 more rows 6.6 Matrix Create a contingency table using a matrix object. matrix &lt;- matrix( c(a = 7, b = 124, c = 1, d = 78), ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE ) # Add names to make the matrix more readable rownames(matrix) &lt;- c(&quot;Appendectomy&quot;, &quot;No Appendectomy&quot;) colnames(matrix) &lt;- c(&quot;Infection&quot;, &quot;No Infection&quot;) matrix ## Infection No Infection ## Appendectomy 7 124 ## No Appendectomy 1 78 Adding summary rows/columns to the matrix. matrix_w_margins &lt;- cbind(matrix, rowsum = rowSums(matrix)) matrix_w_margins &lt;- rbind(matrix_w_margins, colsum = colSums(matrix_w_margins)) matrix_w_margins ## Infection No Infection rowsum ## Appendectomy 7 124 131 ## No Appendectomy 1 78 79 ## colsum 8 202 210 6.7 Table You can coerce a matrix object into a table object. I haven’t found a way to create a table object from scratch (i.e., without making a matrix or data frame first). table &lt;- as.table(matrix) table ## Infection No Infection ## Appendectomy 7 124 ## No Appendectomy 1 78 # Add margins table_w_margins &lt;- addmargins(table) table_w_margins ## Infection No Infection Sum ## Appendectomy 7 124 131 ## No Appendectomy 1 78 79 ## Sum 8 202 210 Aside from adding margins in one step, it isn’t clear what the advantage of coercing the matrix to a table is at this point. However, there may be advantages later when we calculate incidence and other measures of occurrence and association. 6.8 Base R data frame with rownames Create from scratch: df &lt;- data.frame( Infection = c(7, 1), `No Infection` = c(124, 78) ) # Add row names rownames(df) &lt;- c(&quot;Appendectomy&quot;, &quot;No Appendectomy&quot;) df ## Infection No.Infection ## Appendectomy 7 124 ## No Appendectomy 1 78 Add margins: df_w_margins &lt;- df df_w_margins &lt;- cbind(df_w_margins, rowsum = rowSums(df_w_margins)) df_w_margins &lt;- rbind(df_w_margins, colsum = colSums(df_w_margins)) df_w_margins ## Infection No.Infection rowsum ## Appendectomy 7 124 131 ## No Appendectomy 1 78 79 ## colsum 8 202 210 As far as I can tell, there doesn’t seem to be an advantage to creating a df from scratch over creating a matrix from scratch. Create a base R data frame by coercing the matrix object to a data frame: df_w_margins &lt;- as.data.frame(matrix_w_margins) df_w_margins ## Infection No Infection rowsum ## Appendectomy 7 124 131 ## No Appendectomy 1 78 79 ## colsum 8 202 210 Coercing the table object to a data frame gives a different result: as.data.frame(table) ## Var1 Var2 Freq ## 1 Appendectomy Infection 7 ## 2 No Appendectomy Infection 1 ## 3 Appendectomy No Infection 124 ## 4 No Appendectomy No Infection 78 At this point, I think it still makes sense to start with a matrix. You can easily convert a matrix to a data frame later if you need to. 6.9 Tibble Unlike the other objects, this object won’t have the standard contingency table layout. tbl &lt;- tribble( ~appendectomy, ~infection, ~count, &quot;Yes&quot;, &quot;Yes&quot;, 7, &quot;Yes&quot;, &quot;No&quot;, 124, &quot;No&quot;, &quot;Yes&quot;, 1, &quot;No&quot;, &quot;No&quot;, 78 ) # Add margins tbl %&gt;% group_by(appendectomy) %&gt;% mutate(appendectomy_totals = sum(count)) %&gt;% group_by(infection) %&gt;% mutate(infection_totals = sum(count)) %&gt;% ungroup() %&gt;% mutate(margin_total = sum(count)) ## # A tibble: 4 × 6 ## appendectomy infection count appendectomy_totals infection_totals margin_total ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 Yes Yes 7 131 8 210 ## 2 Yes No 124 131 202 210 ## 3 No Yes 1 79 8 210 ## 4 No No 78 79 202 210 This layout can be useful, but this note is really about working with a contingency table layout.

Add some notes about terminology: effect-measure modification vs effect modification vs statistical interaction vs biological interaction. 7.2 🌎Useful websites Modern Epidemiology 7.3 📦Load packages library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE) Modern Epidemiology, 4th edition, page 91-92: Suppose we divide our population into two or more categories or strata, defined by categories of a covariate that is a potential modifier. In each stratum, we can compare the exposed with the unexposed by calculating an effect measure of our choosing.20, 48 Often we would have no reason to suppose that these stratum-specific effect measures would equal one another. If they are not equal, we say that the effect measure is heterogeneous or modified or varies across strata of the modifier. If they are equal, we say that the measure is homogeneous, constant, or uniform across strata of the modifier. Note that what is in view here is how the effect of the exposure varies across strata of the modifier; these variations in the exposure effect may not reflect the effect of the modifier itself but possibly only that of some other variables related to the modifier.49, 50 See Chapter 26 for more complete descriptions of effect modification and effect-measure modification. A major point about effect-measure modification is that, if effects are present, it will usually be the case that no more than one of the effect measures discussed above will be uniform across strata of the modifier.20 In fact, if both the exposure and the modifier have an effect on the outcome, then at most one of the risk ratio or risk difference measures of the effect of the exposure can be uniform across strata of the modifier; in such cases, there will thus always be effect-measure modification for either the difference or the ratio scale. As an example, suppose that, among men, the average risk would be 0.50 if exposed but 0.20 if unexposed, whereas among women the average risk would be 0.10 if exposed but 0.04 if unexposed. Then the causal risk difference for men is 0.50 − 0.20 = 0.30, five times the difference for women of 0.10 − 0.04 = 0.06. In contrast, for both men and women, the causal risk ratio is 0.50 / 0.20 = 0.10 / 0.04 = 2.5. Now suppose we change this example to make the risk differences uniform, say, by making the exposed male risk 0.26 instead of 0.50. Then, both risk differences would be 0.06, but the male risk ratio would be 0.26 / 0.20 = 1.3, much less than the female risk ratio of 2.5. Finally, if we change the example by making the exposed male risk 0.32 instead of 0.50, the male risk difference would be 0.12, double the female risk difference of 0.06, but the male ratio would be 1.6 with relative excess ratio of 0.6, which is less than half the relative excess ratio of 1.5 computed from the female ratio of 2.5. Thus, the presence, direction, and size of effect-measure modification can be dependent on the choice of measure.

Yes, but attributable risk is an older term and it’s use is discouraged. https://sphweb.bumc.bu.edu/otlt/mph-modules/ep/ep713_association/ep713_association_print.html How do you interpret an attributable risk? https://sphweb.bumc.bu.edu/otlt/mph-modules/ep/ep713_association/ep713_association_print.html 8.2 🌎Useful websites Then note on Contingency Tables Boston University 8.3 📦Load packages library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE) library(ggplot2) Using an example from the Boston University website: 8.4 Data Summary Consider the following example regarding the management of Hodgkin lymphoma, a cancer of the lymphatic system. Years ago when a patient was diagnosed with Hodgkin Disease, they would frequently undergo a surgical procedure called a “staging laparotomy.” The purpose of the staging laparotomy was to determine the extent to which the cancer had spread, because this was important information for determining the patient’s prognosis and optimizing treatment. At times, the surgeons performing this procedure would also remove the patient’s appendix, not because it was inflamed; it was done “incidentally” in order to ensure that the patient never had to worry about getting appendicitis. However, performing an appendectomy requires transecting it, and this has the potential to contaminate the abdomen and the wound edges with bacteria normally contained inside the appendix. Some surgeons felt that doing this “incidental appendectomy” did the patient a favor by ensuring that they would never get appendicitis, but others felt that it meant unnecessarily increasing the patient’s risk of getting a post-operative wound infection by spreading around the bacteria that was once inside the appendix. To address this, the surgeons at a large hospital performed a retrospective cohort study. They began by going through the hospital’s medical records to identify all subjects who had had a “staging laparotomy performed for Hodgkin.” They then reviewed the medical record and looked at the operative report to determine whether the patient had an incidental appendectomy or not. They then reviewed the progress notes, the laboratory reports, the nurses notes, and the discharge summary to determine whether the patient had developed a wound infection during the week after surgery. The investigators reviewed the records of 210 patients who had undergone the staging procedure and found that 131 had also had an incidental appendectomy, while the other 79 had not. The data from that study are summarized in the table below. The numbers in the second and third columns indicate the number of subjects who did or did not develop a post-operative wound infection among those who had the incidental appendectomy (in the “Yes” row) and those who did not have the incidental appendectomy (in the “No” row). For example, the upper left cell indicates that seven of the subjects who had an incidental appendectomy (the exposure of interest) subsequently developed a wound infection. The upper right cell indicates that the other 124 subjects who had an incidental appendectomy did NOT develop a wound infection. Had incidental appendectomy? Wound infection No wound infection Total Yes 7 124 131 No 1 78 79 Total 8 202 210 8.5 🔢Simulate data First, simulate the data as a 2x2 contingency table. Here, we will experiment with structuring the contingency table in a few different ways. 8.5.1 Simulate a matrix object Create a contingency table using a matrix object. matrix &lt;- matrix( c(a = 7, b = 124, c = 1, d = 78), ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE ) # Add names to make the matrix more readable rownames(matrix) &lt;- c(&quot;Appendectomy&quot;, &quot;No Appendectomy&quot;) colnames(matrix) &lt;- c(&quot;Infection&quot;, &quot;No Infection&quot;) matrix ## Infection No Infection ## Appendectomy 7 124 ## No Appendectomy 1 78 8.6 📈Analysis 8.6.1 Incidence proportion Before calculating any other measures of occurrence, we first need to calculate the incidence proportion in each exposure group. crosstab_mat &lt;- cbind(matrix, rowsum = rowSums(matrix)) crosstab_mat ## Infection No Infection rowsum ## Appendectomy 7 124 131 ## No Appendectomy 1 78 79 ip &lt;- crosstab_mat[, &quot;Infection&quot;] / crosstab_mat[, &quot;rowsum&quot;] crosstab_mat &lt;- cbind(crosstab_mat, ip) crosstab_mat ## Infection No Infection rowsum ip ## Appendectomy 7 124 131 0.05343511 ## No Appendectomy 1 78 79 0.01265823 8.6.2 Risk Differences Instead of comparing two measures of disease frequency by calculating their ratio, one can compare them in terms of their absolute difference. The risk difference is calculated by subtracting the cumulative incidence in the unexposed group (or least exposed group) from the cumulative incidence in the group with the exposure. \\[ \\text{Risk Difference (RD)} = CI_e - CI_u \\] where (\\(CI_e\\)) = cumulative incidence among the exposed subjects, and (\\(CI_u\\)) is the cumulative incidence among unexposed subjects. The risk difference focuses on absolute effect of the risk factor, or the excess risk of disease in those who have the factor compared with those who don’t. Recall that in the wound infection study, the cumulative incidence of infection was 5.3% in the incidental appendectomy group, and only 1.3% in the group without appendectomies. The risk ratio was 4.2, but we can also compute the absolute difference, which is 5.3 / 100 - 1.3 / 100 = 4 per 100 excess wound infections among those who had the incidental appendectomy. \\(CI_\\)u provides an estimate of the baseline risk (i.e., in the absence of the exposure), and the exposure factor imposes an additional (excess) risk on top of that. 🗒Side Note: Modern Epidemiology 4th edition uses the term incidence proportion instead of cumulative incidence.1 ip_exposed &lt;- crosstab_mat[&quot;Appendectomy&quot;, &quot;ip&quot;] ip_unexposed &lt;- crosstab_mat[&quot;No Appendectomy&quot;, &quot;ip&quot;] risk_difference &lt;- ip_exposed - ip_unexposed risk_difference ## [1] 0.04077689 risk_difference * 100 ## [1] 4.077689 8.6.2.1 Interpretation Subjects who had an incidental appendectomy had 4 additional cases of wound infection per 100 people compared to subjects who did not have an incidental appendectomy. Tip 1: If you have cumulative incidence expressed as percentage, convert % to convenient fractions so that you can express it as the excess risk in a group of people who have the risk factor. Tip 2: Focus your interpretation on the excess risk in the exposed group. Example: “There were 4 excess wound infections per 100 subjects in the group that had incidental appendectomies, compared to the group without incidental appendectomy.” Tip 3: Don’t forget to specify the time interval when using cumulative incidence. This was not a problem in the appendectomy study because the time interval was so short and the time frame was implicit (in the postoperative period), but in most studies you need to describe the time interval for the cumulative incidence in words. Example: “In the group that failed to adhere closely to the Mediterranean diet there were 120 excess deaths per 1,000 men during the two year period of observation compared to the group that did adhere to the Mediterranean diet.” 8.6.2.2 Graph tibble( appendectomy = factor(c(&quot;No&quot;, &quot;No&quot;, &quot;Yes&quot;, &quot;Yes&quot;)), base_rate = c(&quot;Yes&quot;, &quot;No&quot;, &quot;Yes&quot;, &quot;No&quot;), incidence = c(1.3, 0.0, 1.3, 4.0) ) %&gt;% ggplot() + geom_col(aes(x = appendectomy, y = incidence, fill = base_rate)) + scale_fill_manual(values = c(&quot;red&quot;, &quot;gray&quot;)) + labs( x = &quot;Had Incidental Appendectomy&quot;, y = &quot;Wound Infection Incidence per 100&quot; ) + theme_classic() + theme(legend.position = &quot;none&quot;) 🗒Side Note: At some point, come back and annotate this to match the figure here. You may also want to add this to the data visualization note.

I started writing it as I was creating my bradcannell website on 2021-12-21. 9.2 🌎Useful websites Blogdown Book Up &amp; running with blogdown in 2021 Wowchemy docs Netlify custom domains Configure external DNS for a custom domain 9.3 📦Load packages library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE) library(blogdown) When creating my site, I closely followed the steps outlined in Up &amp; running with blogdown in 2021. Below there are some additional notes, and solutions I used for issues I came up against along the way. 9.4 Blogdown commands to remember When you start a new R session, it can be useful to view a preview of the site in the Viewer window. You do that with blogdown::serve_site() To check content blogdown::check_content() To check the status of Netlify blogdown::check_netlify() In the past I got the following error: Checking netlify.toml… Error in find_config() : Cannot find the configuration file config.toml | config.yaml | config/_default/config.toml | config/_default/config.yaml of the website Ultimately, I just had to quit R and reopen – not just restart R session. To check the Hugo versions blogdown::check_hugo() Let’s run one final check, which wraps all 5 checking functions we’ve used so far into a single final checklist: blogdown::check_site() 9.5 Creating new content Here are some notes from when I created the “Students” section of the brad.cannell website. Basically, I want a page were students can view currently available opportunities to get involved in research and find guidance on a range of topics. When creating new content with the Academic template, you can choose to add a widget to the homepage or to create a new page (or set of pages), which can also include widgets. I wanted “students” to be a separate page - not displayed on my homepage. I’m following guidance on Wowchemy’s Create content page to make the students page. 9.5.1 Step 1. Create a landing page I followed the guidance on Wowchemy’s Create a landing page documentation for this step. As a reminder, landing pages don’t necessarily contain much actual content. They contain widgets that link to content. Create the content/students folder. Create index.md inside content/students, and add a YAML header. This will be a widget page like the homepage. Create a nav bar link to the index.md. Open config/_default/menus.yaml Create a new entry Set name: to Students (or whatever you want to appear in the nav bar) Set url: to 'studetns/' (the name of the folder we created in 1 above) Adjust the weight to control the placement of the link on the nav bar 9.5.2 Step 2. Add widgets to the landing page I followed the guidance on Wowchemy’s page builder documentation for this step. I think I want to create the individual jobs (or job categories) as “blog posts” then display them on the students page in a portfolio widget or a featured content widget. I’m playing around with both. 9.5.2.1 Add a welcome section I added a blank widget to the top of the students page and added some welcome text below the YAML header. 9.5.2.2 Add a portfolio widget to the students landing page I opened home/projects.md and saved it as students/opportunities_portfolio.md. Change active: false to active: true. At that point, the widget should should up on the students landing page. I started adjusting some of the parameters in the YAML header. For example, I changed the weight to 20, added a title, etc. Ultimately, I didn’t use the featured content widget. But, if you use it in the future, make sure the featured: parameter in the YAML header is set to true. Otherwise, the post won’t show up in the featured content widget. 9.5.3 Step 3. Add content to the widgets Individual content pages seem to always go in folders. The folders contain index.md files for written content and they also contain any other files the page needs (e.g., images or citation files). The banner photo has to be named featured. For the research opportunities widget on the students page, I created a new folder called opportunites in content. I tried putting it directly in the students folder, but that didn’t work. You tell markdown document that creates the widget (i.e., students/opportunities_portfolio.md) to use the documents in the content/opportunites folder by setting the content: page_type: parameter to the folder name. In this case, content: page_type: opportunites. If you want an image on the content page, it needs to be stored in the same folder as the index.md file that contains the content. Additionally, the image file must be named featured. Here was the YAML header for the GRA content page I made --- # GRA page accessed from the students page via a widget. title: Graduate research assistantships summary: Graduate research assistantships (GRAs) are paid positions. As a GRA, you are sort of a jack of all trades. You may be asked to help with completing human subjects protection documentation for the Institutional Review Board (IRB), data collection, data management and analysis, literature reviews for papers and grants, paper and grant writing, submitting reports to funding agencies, and administrative tasks (e.g., purchasing and arranging travel). date: &quot;2022-03-04&quot; authors: - admin featured: true image: caption: &#39;Photo by &lt;a href=&quot;https://unsplash.com/@esteejanssens?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText&quot;&gt;Estée Janssens&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://unsplash.com/s/photos/schedule?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText&quot;&gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;&#39; focal_point: &quot;&quot; preview_only: false tags: - GRAs --- You can add markdown content below the YAML header. 9.5.4 Step 4. Add a banner image to the landing page. I found an image I wanted to use on unsplash. Copy home/banner.md to students/banner.md. The image file goes in assets/media/. Update the path to the picture and play around with other settings as needed. I adjusted the image size by experimenting with spacing:padding: [\"250px\", \"0\", \"100px\", \"0\"]. Don’t forget to give attribution to the photographer. For example: Photo by &lt;a href=&quot;https://unsplash.com/@homajob?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText&quot;&gt;Scott Graham&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://unsplash.com/@mbcann01/likes?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText&quot;&gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt; Produces: Photo by Scott Graham on Unsplash 9.6 Editing widget metadata content &gt; home 9.7 Editing about widget content This includes degrees and social media stuff. authors &gt; admin &gt; _index.md 9.8 Adjusting site configuration files For example, nav bar. config &gt; _default &gt; 9.9 Other little adjustments Banner image To make my banner image full screen I had to add advanced: css_class: fullscreen To content &gt; home &gt; banner.md Map zoom in the contacts widget I changed the map zoom in the contacts widget to 9 instead of 15. I changed it in params.yaml. Copyright I added a copyright to the website in config.yaml I removed the license stuff from the footer in params.yaml. Search for copyright_license. 9.10 Custom CSS Here is the Wowchemy documentation. I created a custom CSS file at assets/scss/custom.scss. 9.11 Changing the domain Netlify custom domains Configure external DNS for a custom domain I had to add bradcannell.netlify.app to the www CNAME on godaddy. 9.12 Error fixes 9.12.1 blogdown::check_netlify() Checking netlify.toml… Error in find_config() : Cannot find the configuration file config.toml | config.yaml | config/_default/config.toml | config/_default/config.yaml of the website Ultimately, I just had to quit R and reopen – not just restart R session.

I find that it is easier for me to understand new concepts when learning them as a component of a final product.” We won’t necessarily do this for every chapter (e.g., installing R and RStudio) if doing so doesn’t make sense. 11.3 Body 11.3.1 Language Use “we” and “our” language. Make it friendly and informal. 11.3.2 Text conventions Bold text is used to highlight important terms, file names, and file extensions. Not every bolded term needs to go in the glossary. Use your best judgment. Highlighted inline code is used to emphasize small sections of R code and program elements such as variable or function names. 11.3.3 Special sections &lt;p class=&quot;note&quot;&gt; 🗒**Side Note:** This is an example note. &lt;/p&gt; 🗒Side Note: This is an example note. &lt;p class=&quot;warning&quot;&gt; ⚠️**Warning:** This is an example warning &lt;/p&gt; ⚠️Warning: This is an example warning 11.3.4 Images Don’t forget to add “echo=FALSE” to the code chunk. Details on cross-referencing figures are given below. Every figure doesn’t need a caption. It can actually make things look sloppy. The only figures that NEED a caption are those figures that are cross-referenced. Because of the way the files are structured, You won’t be able to see pictures directly in the Rmd files without including “../../” on the front the file paths. However, having “../../” on the front of the file paths prevents the book from building appropriately. You can also directly use img tags. Here’s the one I used for my photo in R4Epi &lt;!-- Cannell profile photo --&gt; &lt;img align=&quot;right&quot; src=&quot;img/index/cannell-headshot copy.png&quot; alt=&quot;R4Epi hex logo&quot; width=&quot;250&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0 1em 0 1em; border-radius: 20px 0px 20px 0px;&quot;&gt; Yihui talks about some of the advantages of using knitr::include_graphics() here: https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/figures.html. Most of them have to do with creating PDF documents. For HTML only, the img tag seems to be a little more customizable. 11.3.5 Font Awesome There are few different ways to incorporate font awesome icons into your output. The font awesome package (https://github.com/rstudio/fontawesome) is my favorite so far.

Give the code chunk that contains the figure a caption (e.g., {r label, echo=FALSE, fig.cap=\"Some text.\"})) Then add \\@ref(fig:exampe-bookdown-img) to the text where you want to cross-reference the figure. ⚠️Warning: The figure reference must go outside of punctuation. With a space. ⚠️Warning: If you want to cross-reference figures or tables generated from a code chunk, please make sure the chunk label only contains alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9), slashes (/), or dashes (-). ⚠️Warning: If you want to cross-reference figures or tables generated from a code chunk, you must give the code chunk a caption. Example: The sentence below is written as “As seen in the figure below. \\@ref(fig:paperpile)” As seen in the figure below. 11.1 11.4.2 Cross-referencing chapters There are a couple different ways you can cross-reference other chapters or other sections of the book. This is adapted from Jenny Bryan’s Happy Git and GitHub for the useR book. 11.4.2.1 Method 1. You can add a CSS id the behind the header using a hashtag inside curly braces (i.e., {#id}). Later, you can reference that section by writing the hash id inside parentheses (i.e., [some text to link](#id)). Method 1 is a good method when the section name is difficult or unwieldy to write out. It may also just be a good idea when you know ahead of time that you will want to cross-reference a section. Example: I added the CSS id {#cr-figs} to the section above called “Cross-referencing figures.” The sentence below is written as “See the section above on [cross-referencing figures](#cr-figs).” See the section above on cross-referencing figures. 11.4.2.2 Method 2 You can add a CSS id the behind the header using a hashtag inside curly braces (i.e., {#id}). Later, you can use the \\@ref(#id) format to make the cross-reference appear as a linked chapter/section number rather than linked text. Method 1 &amp; 2 are good methods when the section name is difficult or unwieldy to write out. They may also just be a good idea when you know ahead of time that you will want to cross-reference a section. The difference is really just a matter of style. Example: I added the CSS id {#cr-figs} to the section above called “Cross-referencing figures.” The sentence below is written as “See the section \\@ref(cr-figs) above about cross-referencing figures.” See the section 11.4.1 above about cross-referencing figures. Notice that I did NOT include the hashtag symbol when referencing the section. 11.4.2.3 Method 3 Simply write out the chapter/section header name inside square brackets (i.e., [Section header name] to create a text link to the chapter/section header. Example: This section is titled “Cross-references.” The sentence below is written as “See the [cross-references] section above.” See the cross-references section above. ⚠️Warning: When using the chapter/section name inside square brackets, make sure to replace spaces with dashes (-). 11.4.2.4 Method 4 Write out some text that you want linked to the chapter/section header inside of square brackets, then immediately follow it with the chapter/section header name inside square brackets (i.e., [linked text][Section header name] to create a text link to the chapter/section header. Example: This section is titled “Cross-references.” The sentence below is written as “See the [section above on cross-referencing][Cross-references].” See the section above on cross-referencing. 11.5 Citations For more details, see Yihui Xie’s Bookdown book. Add whatever you want to cite to Paperpile. Navigate to Paperpile. Click on the document/article you want to cite. Click the drop-down arrow next to the “Cite” button. Click the BibTeX option. This will copy a BibTeX citation to your clipboard. Figure 11.1: A screenshot of selecting BibTex in PaperPile. In RStudio, open book.bib, which should be in your book’s root directory. Paste the BibTeX citation into book.bib. Order the citations alphabetically by author’s last name. Save. For example, here is the book.bib entry for the Yihui Xie’s bookdown book: Then, to cite that book, type @key where you want the citation to appear – the key part of @key is marked in the example above. So, I’m citing Yihui Xie’s bookdown book at the end of this sentence by typing @Xie2021-pn after the period with a space in between.2 🗒Side Note: You can change the citation style using the csl: parameter in index.Rmd. I typically use csl: ama.csl, but you can download other formats from https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles. 11.6 Previewing the chapter Supposed to use “bookdown::preview_chapter(”03_what_is_r.Rmd“)” to preview chapters. I can’t get this to work for some reason. I created a new project that I can use a test environment. It’s in “R4Epi chapters in progress/bookdown_test_environment.” You have to build the whole book, but it should go fast because I don’t have all the chapters. 11.6.1 Miscelaneous Make liberal use of emojis. Start making videos to supplement content. 11.7 Additional resources: function to check Links to cheat sheets, websites, and videos. 11.8 Key terms : function to add to appendix Key terms covered in this chapter. 11.9 Final example code : function to add to appendix Succinct recap of the code used in this chapter without any explanation of how it works. You can use this as a quick reference later. We won’t necessarily do this for every chapter (e.g., installing R and RStudio) if doing so doesn’t make sense.

Modify the YAML header. Here is an example: --- title: &quot;R for Epidemiology&quot; author: &quot;Brad Cannell&quot; date: &quot;2022-03-04&quot; site: bookdown::bookdown_site documentclass: book bibliography: [book.bib, packages.bib] link-citations: yes csl: ama.csl github-repo: brad-cannell/r4epi url: &#39;https://brad-cannell.github.io/r4epi/&#39; description: &quot;This is the textbook for Brad Cannell&#39;s Introduction to R Programming for Epidemiologic Research course.&quot; --- The csl: ama.csl part of the YAML header allows you to change the bibliography style. You can find a list of styles here: https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles For AMA, which I frequently want, you can just copy and paste from your templates folder. First-level headers become chapters. Use {-} at the end of the header if you don’t want the chapter to be numbered. For example # Welcome {-} 12.11 Creating bookdown chapters Each Rmd file is a chapter. Chapters can be broken up into parts. To do so, create a subdirectory for each part inside the chapters folder. The individual Rmd files (i.e. chapters) go inside these folders. I typically prefix each folder name that aligns with the order the parts should appear in. For example 01_getting_started, 02_best_practices, etc. The first Rmd file in each part folder should have only this content: # (PART) Getting Started {-} &lt;!-- This Rmd just creates a part heading in the table of contents --&gt; Name the file 00_part_&lt;part_name&gt; All subsequent content chapters should start with a first level heading only – No YAML. For example, # R scripts. For more on chapter content, see Bookdown template chapter 12.12 Knitting the book Click on the build tab, then click “Build Book.” Commit the changes and push to GitHub. After a few minutes, you should see the GitHub pages version working. 12.13 Errors and warnings Output created: docs/index.html Warning message: In split_chapters(output, gitbook_page, number_sections, split_by, : You have 3 Rmd input file(s) but only 2 first-level heading(s).

L2C Distress Tolerance Scale Paper At least until you figure out make files, I think the best thing to do is save tables and figures as files in the docs folder. Create a single R script to compile them all together and create the report. Use comments to specify what file the table/figure is created in. Still trying to figure out if it’s better to write text in Word and then add in tables and charts with bookmarks, or is it better to write everything in R? In general, it seems helpful/expedient to do as much of the prose and formatting as possible directly in the Word template. Then, just add numbers, tables, and graphs from R with bookmarks. ⚠️Warning: When editing the code chunks below, you will need to add “../../” in front of file paths that retrieve Word docs from or save word docs to the examples folder if you want them to work when you run them interactively. For example, “../../examples/Word Template for Officer.docx.” However, you have to delete the “../../” from the file paths in order for build book to work. 16.2 🌎Useful websites https://stackoverflow.com/ 16.3 📦Load packages library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE) library(officer, warn.conflicts = FALSE) library(flextable, warn.conflicts = FALSE) 16.4 Formatted text Can start with a template doc &lt;- read_docx(&quot;officer_word_template.docx&quot;) Or not doc &lt;- read_docx() %&gt;% body_add_par(&quot;DETECT LEAD Panel Initial Review Report&quot;, style = &quot;heading 1&quot;) %&gt;% body_add_par(paste(&quot;Updated: &quot;, Sys.Date())) %&gt;% body_add_par(&quot;&quot;) %&gt;% body_add_fpar( fpar( ftext( &quot;Total Initial Assessments:&quot;, prop = fp_text( font.family = &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, font.size = 11 ) ) ) ) print( doc, &quot;examples/officer_formatted_text.docx&quot; ) Link to Word Document on Dropbox # Output Word document # Update the year and month in the file name dynamically print( doc, paste(Sys.Date() %&gt;% format(&quot;%Y-%m&quot;), &quot; Initial Review Report.docx&quot;) ) 16.5 Bulleted list It’s possible to do. You need to make sure you create a bullet style in the template Word doc.

From the Sun Study. Need to clean up when I get time. Start with the same document we just made above. # Create Word doc ss_report &lt;- read_docx(&quot;examples/Word Template for Officer.docx&quot;) %&gt;% body_add_par(&quot;Sun Study Outcomes Report&quot;, style = &quot;heading 1&quot;) %&gt;% body_add_par(&quot;\\n&quot;) %&gt;% body_add_par(paste(&quot;Updated: &quot;, Sys.Date())) %&gt;% body_add_par(&quot;\\n&quot;) # Output Word document print( ss_report, &quot;examples/officer_bullets.docx&quot; ) Link to Word Document on Dropbox Now add a new section to the document. Section 1. Report on missing data # Load report and add to the end? ss_report &lt;- read_docx(&quot;examples/officer_bullets.docx&quot;) %&gt;% body_add_par(&quot;Test Text&quot;) # Output Word document print( ss_report, &quot;examples/officer_add_to_end.docx&quot; ) Link to Word Document on Dropbox This works. However, there was no advantage to doing it this way in the Sun Study example. In fact, what I’ve found in general is that it typically works best to do as much adding text and formatting things as possible directly in the Word template. Then, just pretty much add flextables and plots to the Word template. 16.7 Using bookmarks Writing everything in an R script and then compiling to a Word document works alright, but wrapping everything in officer functions makes it hard to read. In this section, I’m seeing if I can type all the narrative in the Word template, then just add tables and figures into the Word template at bookmarks. Website about bookmarks: https://davidgohel.github.io/officer/reference/body_replace_text_at_bkm.html Have to create this with point and click in Word: http://howtomicrosoftofficetutorials.blogspot.com/2017/03/use-bookmarks-in-word-2016-for-mac.html Use Insert &gt; Links &gt; Bookmark If you don’t add other text around the bookmark, you will get this error: Error: bookmark ‘example_table’ does not end in the same paragraph (or is on the whole paragraph) A hacky fix is to enclose bookmark text with bm text . Make sure only the “text” part is the bookmark. I also found that you can’t continue piping the document after you’ve added a flextable at a bookmark. You have to start overwriting the Word document object. See LEAD Panel Summary Report as an example. doc_w_bookmarks &lt;- read_docx(&quot;examples/Word Template for Officer Bookmarks.docx&quot;) %&gt;% body_replace_flextable_at_bkm( bookmark = &quot;example_table&quot;, value = flextable(head(mtcars)) ) print( doc_w_bookmarks, &quot;examples/officer_bookmarks.docx&quot; ) Link to Word Document on Dropbox After figuring this out, I think it makes more sense to write in Word and replace tables and figures with bookmarks. For ggplot graphs, it looks like you need to use ggsave to save the plot as an image file. Then, use the image file as the value to body_replace_img_at_bkm() Don’t forget to use external_img() Example from L2C quarterly report: doc &lt;- doc %&gt;% body_replace_text_at_bkm(&quot;n_phone_terminations&quot;, as.character(n_phone_terminations)) %&gt;% body_replace_img_at_bkm( &quot;fig_phone_terminations&quot;, external_img(&quot;fig_1.jpeg&quot;, width = 7, height = 4) ) For images, just add the bookmark to the end of the title without surrounding it with “bm.” For example, “Figure 1. Overall trend in sunscreen application outcomes by study p_overall” Where “p_overall is the bookmark. Otherwise, the”bm\" will still be there. For best results, the width and height used in ggsave() should match the width and height in external_img(). Deciding on the correct width and height might take some trial and error. To add an updated date, use this: doc_w_bookmarks &lt;- doc_w_bookmarks %&gt;% body_replace_text_at_bkm(&quot;date&quot;, as.character(Sys.Date())) "],["tables.html", "17 Tables 17.1 ⭐️Overview 17.2 Projects to review and incorporate 17.3 🌎Useful websites 17.4 📦Load packages 17.5 🔢Simulate data 17.6 🔵 Example: Table 1", " 17 Tables 17.1 ⭐️Overview This chapter is about formatting and presenting statistical results in tables. The immediate results of statistical analyses are rarely fit for general consumption. This chapter walks through strategies and functions we can use to make our results ready for presentation/dissemination. Tables are one of the most popular ways to present information to our audience. When our goal is to show our readers precise numerical summaries of our data, the exact values that resulted from our analysis are important. However, the specific details that we may want to present from table to table, or the way in which we want to present them, can vary widely. For example, an initial table of descriptive information about our participants may or may not be stratified by subgroups of interest. Additionally, it may include variables of different types, and for any given type, it may include various different kinds of numerical summaries. Further, there are numerous types of inferential models that result in numerical summaries that we may want to present in a table. For these reasons, it is difficult to create a good one-size-fits-all approach to automating the process of making results ready for presentation and dissemination. Having said that, below we walk through some basic strategies for automating the processes of putting results into presentation-ready summary tables – and in a way that makes updating them (which happens A LOT) as painless as possible. 17.2 Projects to review and incorporate stroke study -&gt; table_characteristics_by_network.Rmd to see an example of doing this with purrr::map. When you have time, you should add an example into this document. See Sun Study Report Template for a good example of automating this with Officer and Flextable. I used a little different method in Link2Care &gt; paper_smartphone_app &gt; table_use_app.Rmd. Try to work some of that in below. /Users/bradcannell/Dropbox/01 Research/Elder Abuse/DETECT NIH RFA-AG-18-010/LEAD Panel/summarise_lead_votes/report_filemaker.Rmd This chapter also kind of overlaps with the Flexdashboard and Officer chapters. At some point, I should think about the best way to link and organize the chapters. Another option is to put all the flextable stuff in this chapter. I might still want a separate chapter about officer. 17.3 🌎Useful websites Officer Word document generation Flextable Overview R gtsummary package 17.4 📦Load packages library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE) library(DT) library(meantables) library(freqtables) library(tidyr) library(purrr) library(flextable, warn.conflicts = FALSE) library(officer) 17.5 🔢Simulate data Have you noticed how we will often calculate the same statistical measures for many different variables in our data? For example, let’s say that we have some pretty standard data about some study participants that looks like this: study &lt;- tibble( id = c(1:100), age = c(32, 30, 32, 29, 24, 38, 25, 24, 48, 29, 22, 29, 24, 28, 24, 25, 25, 22, 25, 24, 25, 24, 23, 24, 31, 24, 29, 24, 22, 23, 26, 23, 24, 25, 24, 33, 27, 25, 26, 26, 26, 26, 26, 27, 24, 43, 25, 24, 27, 28, 29, 24, 26, 28, 25, 24, 26, 24, 26, 31, 24, 26, 31, 34, 26, 25, 27, 40, 35, 43, 81, 18, 79, 45, 37, 66, 35, 81, 50, 54, 24, 47, 84, 38, 23, 74, 77, 65, 46, 55, 41, 84, 41, 29, 60, 60, 40, 53, 31, 77), age_group = c(2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2), gender = c(2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1), ht_in = c(70, 63, 62, 67, 67, 58, 64, 69, 65, 68, 63, 68, 69, 66, 67, 65, 64, 75, 67, 63, 60, 67, 64, 73, 62, 69, 67, 62, 68, 66, 66, 62, 64, 68, NA, 68, 70, 68, 68, 66, 71, 61, 62, 64, 64, 63, 67, 66, 69, 76, NA, 63, 64, 65, 65, 71, 66, 65, 65, 71, 64, 71, 60, 62, 61, 69, 66, NA, 73, 71, 72, 76, 74, 63, 65, 65, 73, 76, 66, 58, 65, 65, 65, 68, 71, 68, 60, 70, 68, 62, 74, 68, 76, 72, 59, 76, 61, 72, 69, 59), wt_lbs = c(216, 106, 145, 195, 143, 125, 138, 140, 158, 167, 145, 297, 146, 125, 111, 125, 130, 182, 170, 121, 98, 150, 132, 250, 137, 124, 186, 148, 134, 155, 122, 142, 110, 132, 188, 176, 188, 166, 136, 147, 178, 125, 102, 140, 139, 60, 147, 147, 141, 232, 186, 212, 110, 110, 115, 154, 140, 150, 130, NA, 171, 156, 92, 122, 102, 163, 141, NA, 106, 118, 205, 229, 198, 255, 268, 203, 269, 162, 115, 106, 139, 246, 147, 206, 202, 209, 123, 265, 119, 171, 195, 136, 208, 108, 201, 224, 261, 169, 295, 93) ) %&gt;% # Add calculated variables mutate( bmi = round(wt_lbs / ht_in^2 * 703, 2), bmi_4cat = case_when( is.na(bmi) ~ NA_real_, # Missing bmi &lt; 18.5 ~ 1, # Underweight bmi &lt; 25 ~ 2, # Normal weight bmi &lt; 30 ~ 3, # Overweight TRUE ~ 4 # Obese ) ) %&gt;% # Create exposure and outcome where, # Exposure is more likely in people over age 30 and # Outcome is more likely in peeople with exposure mutate( exposure = if_else( age_group == 1, sample(c(0,1), 100, TRUE, c(.9, .1)), sample(c(0,1), 100, TRUE, c(.7, .3)) ), outcome = if_else( exposure == 1, sample(c(0,1), 100, TRUE, c(.8, .2)), sample(c(0,1), 100, TRUE, c(.5, .5)) ) ) %&gt;% # Make factors mutate( age_group = factor(age_group, labels = c(&quot;Younger than 30&quot;, &quot;30 and Older&quot;)), gender = factor(gender, labels = c(&quot;Female&quot;, &quot;Male&quot;)), bmi_4cat = factor(bmi_4cat, labels = c(&quot;Underweight&quot;, &quot;Normal&quot;, &quot;Overweight&quot;, &quot;Obese&quot;)), exposure = factor(exposure, labels = c(&quot;No&quot;, &quot;Yes&quot;)), outcome = factor(outcome, labels = c(&quot;No&quot;, &quot;Yes&quot;)) ) datatable(study, options = list(scrollX = TRUE)) 17.6 🔵 Example: Table 1 This first example is perhaps the most common type of table we will create – a Table 1 – or basic descriptive table about our participants.

Calculate the outcome distribution As our first step, we typically want to see how many people have each value for the outcome of interest. We will also store these values so that we can add them to our table header as (N = XX) later. n_outcome &lt;- study %&gt;% count(outcome) %&gt;% pull(n) %&gt;% set_names(levels(study$outcome)) n_outcome ## No Yes ## 51 49 17.6.2 Step 2. Prepare to calculate summary statistics 17.6.2.1 Calculate statistics for single variables Eventually, we are going to want to calculate summary statistics for multiple different variables that will go into our Table 1. Before we do that, it can be useful to write code that will calculate the summary statistics we are interested in for one continuous variable and one categorical variable. Later, we can use iterative processing to apply that code to all of the variables we are interested in. 🗒Side Note: This chapter isn’t about how to calculate or interpret all the various different statistics we may want to calculate from project to project. For more details on descriptive statistics see: R4Epi Descriptive Analysis meantables freqtables 17.6.2.1.1 One continuous variable In this example, we want to calculate the mean and 95% confidence interval for continuous variables. Because this is an example, we will break it down into multiple steps. In a real analysis, we would probably put all of the code in this section into a single code chunk. Calculations Do the basic calculations. Here we are using the mean_table() function from the meantables package. one_cont_var &lt;- study %&gt;% group_by(outcome) %&gt;% mean_table(age) %&gt;% print() ## # A tibble: 2 × 11 ## response_var group_var group_cat n mean sd sem lcl ucl min ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 age outcome No 51 34.9 15.2 2.13 30.6 39.2 22 ## 2 age outcome Yes 49 35.4 18.2 2.59 30.1 40.6 18 ## # … with 1 more variable: max &lt;dbl&gt; Format statistics Combine the mean and 95% confidence interval into a single variable and keep only the columns of interest for reporting. Additionally, we no longer need the group_var column and we will rename response_var to var to make it easier to row bind with our categorical variables later. one_cont_var &lt;- one_cont_var %&gt;% mean_format(&quot;mean (lcl - ucl)&quot;, name = &quot;mean_95&quot;) %&gt;% select(var = response_var, group_cat, mean_95) %&gt;% print() ## # A tibble: 2 × 3 ## var group_cat mean_95 ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 age No 34.9 (30.62 - 39.18) ## 2 age Yes 35.35 (30.13 - 40.56) Display by group_cat In the final table, we don’t want the results stacked on top of each other vertically, we want them spread out horizontally across columns – one column for each level (i.e., category) of our outcome variable. We can use pivot_wider() from the tidyr package to do this. See the chapter on restructuring data frames for more info on pivot_wider. one_cont_var &lt;- one_cont_var %&gt;% pivot_wider( names_from = &quot;group_cat&quot;, values_from = &quot;mean_95&quot; ) %&gt;% print() ## # A tibble: 1 × 3 ## var No Yes ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 age 34.9 (30.62 - 39.18) 35.35 (30.13 - 40.56) Add a blank row Finally, we want to add a blank row to the bottom of our results table. This will create some vertical separation between variables in our table when we eventually row bind all the variables together. one_cont_var &lt;- one_cont_var %&gt;% add_row(var = &quot;&quot;) %&gt;% print() ## # A tibble: 2 × 3 ## var No Yes ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 &quot;age&quot; 34.9 (30.62 - 39.18) 35.35 (30.13 - 40.56) ## 2 &quot;&quot; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; Putting it all together And that’s the final result we are looking for. Putting it all together, it looks like this: one_cont_var &lt;- study %&gt;% # Calculations group_by(outcome) %&gt;% mean_table(age) %&gt;% # Format statistics mean_format(&quot;mean (lcl - ucl)&quot;, name = &quot;mean_95&quot;) %&gt;% select(var = response_var, group_cat, mean_95) %&gt;% # Display by group_cat pivot_wider( names_from = &quot;group_cat&quot;, values_from = &quot;mean_95&quot; ) %&gt;% # Add a blank row add_row(var = &quot;&quot;) %&gt;% print() ## # A tibble: 2 × 3 ## var No Yes ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 &quot;age&quot; 34.9 (30.62 - 39.18) 35.35 (30.13 - 40.56) ## 2 &quot;&quot; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; Below, we will combine the whole sequence together into a function that we can call repeatedly on each of our continuous variables. 17.6.2.1.2 One categorical variable In this example, we want to calculate the row percent and 95% confidence interval for categorical variables. Because this is an example, we will break it down into multiple steps. In a real analysis, we would probably put all of the code in this section into a single code chunk. Calculations Do the basic calculations.

Instead, we want the results spread out horizontally across columns – one column for each level (i.e., category) of our outcome variable. We can use pivot_wider() from the tidyr package to do this. See the chapter on restructuring data frames for more info on pivot_wider. one_cat_var &lt;- one_cat_var %&gt;% pivot_wider( names_from = &quot;row_cat&quot;, values_from = &quot;percent_95&quot; ) %&gt;% print() ## # A tibble: 2 × 4 ## var col_cat No Yes ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 age_group Younger than 30 56.86 (42.79 - 69.91) 63.27 (48.74 - 75.73) ## 2 age_group 30 and Older 43.14 (30.09 - 57.21) 36.73 (24.27 - 51.26) Add spaces in front of category labels In our final Word table, we will want our category labels (e.g., “Younger than 30” and “30 and Older”) to be indented slightly relative to the row variable label (e.g., “age_group”). We will go ahead and add 2 spaces now. 🗒Side Note: The spaces won’t be visible while testing in RStudio, but they will show up in the final Word document. one_cat_var &lt;- one_cat_var %&gt;% mutate(col_cat = paste0(&quot; &quot;, col_cat)) %&gt;% print() ## # A tibble: 2 × 4 ## var col_cat No Yes ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 age_group &quot; Younger than 30&quot; 56.86 (42.79 - 69.91) 63.27 (48.74 - 75.73) ## 2 age_group &quot; 30 and Older&quot; 43.14 (30.09 - 57.21) 36.73 (24.27 - 51.26) Slide category labels under row variable label In our final Word table, we will want our category labels (e.g., “Younger than 30” and “30 and Older”) to be in the same column – and underneath – the row variable label (e.g., “age_group”). In other words, we want our final table to look like this: Characteristic No Yes Age Group Younger than 30 56.14 (42.86 - 68.59) 65.12 (49.54 - 78.02) 30 and Older 43.86 (31.41 - 57.14) 34.88 (21.98 - 50.46) Instead of this: Characteristic Category No Yes Age Group Younger than 30 56.14 (42.86 - 68.59) 65.12 (49.54 - 78.02) Age group 30 and Older 43.86 (31.41 - 57.14) 34.88 (21.98 - 50.46) To do this, we will: Add a new top row to the data frame that will contain the variable label in the current col_cat column. Drop the current var column, which is no longer needed. Rename the col_cat to var to make it easier to row bind with our categorical variables later. one_cat_var &lt;- one_cat_var %&gt;% add_row(col_cat = &quot;age_group&quot;, .before = 1) %&gt;% select(-var, var = col_cat) %&gt;% print() ## # A tibble: 3 × 3 ## var No Yes ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 &quot;age_group&quot; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; ## 2 &quot; Younger than 30&quot; 56.86 (42.79 - 69.91) 63.27 (48.74 - 75.73) ## 3 &quot; 30 and Older&quot; 43.14 (30.09 - 57.21) 36.73 (24.27 - 51.26) Add a blank row Finally, we want to add a blank row to the bottom of our results table. This will create some vertical separation between variables in our table when we eventually row bind all the variables together. one_cat_var &lt;- one_cat_var %&gt;% add_row(var = &quot;&quot;) %&gt;% print() ## # A tibble: 4 × 3 ## var No Yes ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 &quot;age_group&quot; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; ## 2 &quot; Younger than 30&quot; 56.86 (42.79 - 69.91) 63.27 (48.74 - 75.73) ## 3 &quot; 30 and Older&quot; 43.14 (30.09 - 57.21) 36.73 (24.27 - 51.26) ## 4 &quot;&quot; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; Putting it all together And that’s the final result we are looking for. Putting it all together, it looks like this: one_cat_var &lt;- study %&gt;% # Calculations freq_table(outcome, age_group) %&gt;% # Format statistics freq_format(&quot;percent_row (lcl_row - ucl_row)&quot;, name = &quot;percent_95&quot;, digits = 2) %&gt;% # Keep columns of interest select(row_cat, var = col_var, col_cat, percent_95) %&gt;% # Display by row_cat pivot_wider( names_from = &quot;row_cat&quot;, values_from = &quot;percent_95&quot; ) %&gt;% # Add spaces in front of category labels mutate(col_cat = paste0(&quot; &quot;, col_cat)) %&gt;% # Slide category labels under row variable label add_row(col_cat = &quot;age_group&quot;, .before = 1) %&gt;% select(-var, var = col_cat) %&gt;% # Add a blank row add_row(var = &quot;&quot;) %&gt;% print() ## # A tibble: 4 × 3 ## var No Yes ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 &quot;age_group&quot; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; ## 2 &quot; Younger than 30&quot; 56.86 (42.79 - 69.91) 63.27 (48.74 - 75.73) ## 3 &quot; 30 and Older&quot; 43.14 (30.09 - 57.21) 36.73 (24.27 - 51.26) ## 4 &quot;&quot; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; Below, we will combine the whole sequence together into a function that we can call repeatedly on each of our continuous variables. 17.6.2.2 Create helper functions Above, we saw how to calculate the summary statistics we wanted for one continuous variable and one categorical variable. We could repeat that process for each variable we are interested in using copy and paste, but it is much more efficient and much less error prone to wrap those processes in a function that we can call repeatedly on each variable we want to analyze. That’s what we will do in this section. In each of the code chunks below, all we’re going to do is cut the copy the code from above, paste it below, wrap it in the function() function, and then make a few tweaks that will allow us to repeatedly pass variable names into the code. See the chapter on writing functions for more info on pivot_wider. 17.6.2.2.1 Continuous stats function cont_stats_fn &lt;- function(.data, .outcome, .pred, .digits = 0) { .data %&gt;% # Calculations group_by({{ .outcome }}) %&gt;% mean_table({{ .pred }}) %&gt;% # Format statistics mean_format(&quot;mean (lcl - ucl)&quot;, name = &quot;mean_95&quot;) %&gt;% select(var = response_var, group_cat, mean_95) %&gt;% # Display by group_cat pivot_wider( names_from = &quot;group_cat&quot;, values_from = &quot;mean_95&quot; ) %&gt;% # Add a blank row add_row(var = &quot;&quot;) } # For testing cont_stats_fn(study, outcome, age, .digits = 1) ## # A tibble: 2 × 3 ## var No Yes ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 &quot;age&quot; 34.9 (30.62 - 39.18) 35.35 (30.13 - 40.56) ## 2 &quot;&quot; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; 17.6.2.2.2 Categoorical stats function cat_stats_fn &lt;- function(.data, .outcome, .pred, .digits = 0) { .data %&gt;% # Remove rows with missing values filter(!is.na({{ .pred }})) %&gt;% # Calculations freq_table({{ .outcome }}, {{ .pred }}) %&gt;% # Format statistics freq_format(&quot;percent_row (lcl_row - ucl_row)&quot;, name = &quot;percent_95&quot;, digits = 2) %&gt;% # Keep columns of interest select(row_cat, var = col_var, col_cat, percent_95) %&gt;% # Display by row_cat pivot_wider( names_from = &quot;row_cat&quot;, values_from = &quot;percent_95&quot; ) %&gt;% # Add spaces in front of category labels mutate(col_cat = paste0(&quot; &quot;, col_cat)) %&gt;% # Slide category labels under row variable label add_row(col_cat = !!quo_name(enquo(.pred)), .before = 1) %&gt;% select(-var, var = col_cat) %&gt;% # Add a blank row add_row(var = &quot;&quot;) } # For testing cat_stats_fn(study, outcome, bmi_4cat, .digits = 1) ## # A tibble: 6 × 3 ## var No Yes ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 &quot;bmi_4cat&quot; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; ## 2 &quot; Underweight&quot; 6.25 (1.98 - 18.07) 12.50 (5.62 - 25.53) ## 3 &quot; Normal&quot; 45.83 (32.12 - 60.21) 52.08 (37.84 - 65.99) ## 4 &quot; Overweight&quot; 22.92 (12.99 - 37.19) 25.00 (14.59 - 39.42) ## 5 &quot; Obese&quot; 25.00 (14.59 - 39.42) 10.42 (4.31 - 23.08) ## 6 &quot;&quot; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; 17.6.3 Step 3. Create a data frame that contains our summary statistics In general, we won’t want to present or distribute summary statistics in the form of an R data frame. However, an preliminary step in creating our final table – regardless of the method we use – will usually be to create an R data frame that contains our summary statistics of interest. The next step in this proc cont_cols &lt;- c(&quot;age&quot;, &quot;ht_in&quot;, &quot;wt_lbs&quot;, &quot;bmi&quot;) cat_cols &lt;- c(&quot;age_group&quot;, &quot;gender&quot;, &quot;bmi_4cat&quot;, &quot;exposure&quot;) 17.6.3.1 Repeatedly apply cont_stats_fn Calculate summary statistics for each of the continuous variables we are interested in. Each time we pass a new variable to cont_stats_fn the result will be a data frame of summary statistics for that variable. For now, we will save each of those data frames to a list that we can later reorder and row bind together. stats_list &lt;- cont_cols %&gt;% set_names(cont_cols) %&gt;% map(~ cont_stats_fn(study, outcome, !! sym(.x))) 17.6.3.2 Repeatedly apply cat_stats_fn Calculate summary statistics for each of the categorical variables we are interested in. Each time we pass a new variable to cat_stats_fn the result will be a data frame of summary statistics for that variable. For now, we will save each of those data frames to a list that we can later reorder and row bind together. stats_list &lt;- c( stats_list, cat_cols %&gt;% set_names(cat_cols) %&gt;% map(~ cat_stats_fn(study, outcome, !! sym(.x))) ) At this point, stats_list contains all of our summary statistics of interest as a list of data frames. 17.6.3.3 Bind together the continuous and categorical summary stats table_1 &lt;- map_dfr( .x = c(&quot;exposure&quot;, &quot;age&quot;, &quot;age_group&quot;, &quot;gender&quot;, &quot;ht_in&quot;, &quot;wt_lbs&quot;, &quot;bmi&quot;, &quot;bmi_4cat&quot;), .f = ~ bind_rows(stats_list[[.x]]) ) %&gt;% print() ## # A tibble: 26 × 3 ## var No Yes ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 &quot;exposure&quot; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; ## 2 &quot; No&quot; 76.47 (62.65 - 86.30) 91.84 (79.81 - 96.97) ## 3 &quot; Yes&quot; 23.53 (13.70 - 37.35) 8.16 (3.03 - 20.19) ## 4 &quot;&quot; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; ## 5 &quot;age&quot; 34.9 (30.62 - 39.18) 35.35 (30.13 - 40.56) ## 6 &quot;&quot; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; ## 7 &quot;age_group&quot; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; ## 8 &quot; Younger than 30&quot; 56.86 (42.79 - 69.91) 63.27 (48.74 - 75.73) ## 9 &quot; 30 and Older&quot; 43.14 (30.09 - 57.21) 36.73 (24.27 - 51.26) ## 10 &quot;&quot; &lt;NA&gt; &lt;NA&gt; ## # … with 16 more rows Remove the final blank row. It makes the Word table look cleaner. table_1 &lt;- slice(table_1, -nrow(table_1)) 🗒Side Note: It might be interesting/worthwhile to come back to this at some point and turn everything from in “Step 3. Create a data frame that contains our summary statistics” into a function. 17.6.4 Step 5. Create flextable At this point, we have a complete table of summary statistics and it is roughly laid out in the way we want it to be. But, as we discussed above, we don’t want to present or distribute summary statistics in the form of an R data frame. The flextable package is one awesome tool we can use to transform our data frames of summary statistics into presentation-ready tables for Word, PowerPoint, or HTML documents. The flextable chapter gives more details on using the flextable package. But, for the sake of completeness, we will go ahead and finish our formatted Table 1. Technically, the following single function call will turn our Table 1 into a flextable object. table_1_ft &lt;- flextable(table_1) table_1_ft .tabwid table{ border-spacing:0px !important; border-collapse:collapse; line-height:1; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; border-width: 0; display: table; margin-top: 1.275em; margin-bottom: 1.275em; border-color: transparent; } .tabwid_left table{ margin-left:0; } .tabwid_right table{ margin-right:0; } .tabwid td { padding: 0; } .tabwid a { text-decoration: none; } .tabwid thead { background-color: transparent; } .tabwid tfoot { background-color: transparent; } .tabwid table tr { background-color: transparent; } .cl-5bf653e2{}.cl-5bf19ec4{font-family:'Helvetica';font-size:11pt;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;text-decoration:none;color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);background-color:transparent;}.cl-5bf1ac98{margin:0;text-align:left;border-bottom: 0 solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);border-top: 0 solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);border-left: 0 solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);border-right: 0 solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);padding-bottom:5pt;padding-top:5pt;padding-left:5pt;padding-right:5pt;line-height: 1;background-color:transparent;}.cl-5bf1e320{width:54pt;background-color:transparent;vertical-align: middle;border-bottom: 0 solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);border-top: 0 solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);border-left: 0 solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);border-right: 0 solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);margin-bottom:0;margin-top:0;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;}.cl-5bf1e32a{width:54pt;background-color:transparent;vertical-align: middle;border-bottom: 2pt solid rgba(102, 102, 102, 1.00);border-top: 0 solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);border-left: 0 solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);border-right: 0 solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);margin-bottom:0;margin-top:0;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;}.cl-5bf1e32b{width:54pt;background-color:transparent;vertical-align: middle;border-bottom: 2pt solid rgba(102, 102, 102, 1.00);border-top: 2pt solid rgba(102, 102, 102, 1.00);border-left: 0 solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);border-right: 0 solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);margin-bottom:0;margin-top:0;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;} varNoYesexposure No76.47 (62.65 - 86.30)91.84 (79.81 - 96.97) Yes23.53 (13.70 - 37.35)8.16 (3.03 - 20.19)age34.9 (30.62 - 39.18)35.35 (30.13 - 40.56)age_group Younger than 3056.86 (42.79 - 69.91)63.27 (48.74 - 75.73) 30 and Older43.14 (30.09 - 57.21)36.73 (24.27 - 51.26)gender Female58.82 (44.68 - 71.64)55.10 (40.83 - 68.58) Male41.18 (28.36 - 55.32)44.90 (31.42 - 59.17)ht_in66.88 (65.56 - 68.2)66.5 (65.29 - 67.71)wt_lbs165.44 (151.92 - 178.96)155.21 (140.71 - 169.71)bmi26.03 (23.76 - 28.31)24.38 (22.5 - 26.27)bmi_4cat Underweight6.25 (1.98 - 18.07)12.50 (5.62 - 25.53) Normal45.83 (32.12 - 60.21)52.08 (37.84 - 65.99) Overweight22.92 (12.99 - 37.19)25.00 (14.59 - 39.42) Obese25.00 (14.59 - 39.42)10.42 (4.31 - 23.08) 17.6.5 Step 6. Formatting flextable The flextable object we created above is a good start; however, we will still want to do some additional formatting before presenting our final table 1 to others. 🗒Side Note: We could have done some of this formatting directly in the R data frame, but it’s generally a good idea to do formatting in the flextable object when possible. table_1_ft &lt;- table_1_ft %&gt;% # Change column widths. figure out through trial and error width(width = c(2.5, 2.01, 2.01)) %&gt;% # Center the final two columns align(j = c(2, 3), align = &quot;center&quot;, part = &quot;all&quot;) %&gt;% # Change header names -- add subgroup Ns to headers set_header_labels( var = &quot;Characteristic&quot;, No = paste0(&quot;No\\n(n=&quot;, n_outcome[&quot;No&quot;], &quot;)&quot;), Yes = paste0(&quot;Yes\\n(n=&quot;, n_outcome[&quot;Yes&quot;], &quot;)&quot;) ) %&gt;% # Bold column headers bold(part = &quot;header&quot;) %&gt;% # Edit row headers compose(i = ~ var == &quot;exposure&quot;, j = 1, as_paragraph(&quot;Exposure, row percent (95% CI)&quot;)) %&gt;% compose(i = ~ var == &quot;age&quot;, j = 1, as_paragraph(&quot;Age, mean (95% CI)&quot;)) %&gt;% compose(i = ~ var == &quot;age_group&quot;, j = 1, as_paragraph(&quot;Age group, row percent (95% CI)&quot;)) %&gt;% compose(i = ~ var == &quot;gender&quot;, j = 1, as_paragraph(&quot;Gender, row percent (95% CI)&quot;)) %&gt;% compose(i = ~ var == &quot;ht_in&quot;, j = 1, as_paragraph(&quot;Height, mean (95% CI)&quot;)) %&gt;% compose(i = ~ var == &quot;wt_lbs&quot;, j = 1, as_paragraph(&quot;Weight, mean (95% CI)&quot;)) %&gt;% compose(i = ~ var == &quot;bmi&quot;, j = 1, as_paragraph(&quot;BMI, mean (95% CI)&quot;)) %&gt;% compose(i = ~ var == &quot;bmi_4cat&quot;, j = 1, as_paragraph(&quot;BMI category, row percent (95% CI)&quot;)) %&gt;% # Add footnotes footnote( i = c(5, 15, 17), j = 1, value = as_paragraph( c(&quot;Age in years.&quot;, &quot;Height in inches.&quot;, &quot;Weight in pounds.&quot;) ) ) %&gt;% # Remove vertical cell padding padding(padding.top = 0, padding.bottom = 0, part = &quot;all&quot;) %&gt;% # Change font to TNR 11 font(fontname = &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, part = &quot;all&quot;) %&gt;% fontsize(part = &quot;all&quot;, size = 11) table_1_ft .tabwid table{ border-spacing:0px !important;

The goal is not to make you a git expert — I’m not a git expert myself. Instead, the goal is to teach you enough git to work with me and my team on research projects. I will also provide you with some additional resources in case you want to become an expert. 18.2 🌎Useful websites How to Use Git/GitHub with R Git Book Happy Git and GitHub for the useR GitHub Hello World tutorial 18.3 Get rid of .DS_Store The .DS_Store file can be an annoyance when working with Git on MacOS. Here is a link to instructions for removing .DS_Store from your repository. Do it early and never worry about it again. In the terminal, run the following code from the root directory: # Remove existing files from the repository: find . -name &quot;*.DS_Store&quot; -type f -exec git-rm {} \\; # Add .DS_Store to .gitignore echo .DS_Store &gt;&gt; .gitignore # Commit the file to the repo git add .gitignore git commit -m &#39;.DS_Store banished!&#39; 18.4 Amend Edit -&gt; commit -&gt; edit -&gt; amend -&gt; commit = no problem! Edit -&gt; commit -&gt; push -&gt; edit -&gt; amend -&gt; commit -&gt; push = problem! Short answer, don’t do it. Adding more chages to your last commit 18.5 Pull Requests Instructions for leaving comments Very simple merge conflicts can be resolved directly on GitHub.com Use command line instructions to try out the code to resolve more complex merge conflicts. Example command line pull request merge conflict If there are already changes on the branch (so you can’t pull), you need to either: Commit the changes on the branch (if you want to keep them) Throw away local changes with git checkout -f, and then remove untracked files with git clean -fd 18.6 Branches Naming convention: issue-#-short-description Basic workflow: Create new branch - never develop on Master Push new branch to remote Do some work - commit - amend - push along the way When work is done, create a pull request for Master Deal with merge conflicts if they exist, and merge into Master Delete development branch Merging specific files from another branch. Also, if you haven’t committed the files you don’t want to move over yet: Commit just the files you DO want to merge into master. Push Create a request to pull the changes you just committed into the master branch. Don’t delete the issue branch. Just continue working on the files you don’t commit and merge with the pull request.

Cohort. A group of persons for whom membership is defined in a permanent fashion, or a population in which membership is determined by satisfying a set of defining events and so becomes permanent. An example of a cohort would be the members of the graduating class of a school in a given year… With this definition, the members of any cohort constitute a closed population along the time axis in which the chronologically last defining event (e.g., birth with Down syndrome or study recruitment) is taken as the index time.1 Closed population. A closed population adds no new members over time and loses members only to death.1 Open population. Open populations may gain members over time, through immigration or birth, or lose members over time through emigration or death.1 Think of a population defined by a geographic area or political boundary. 19.3.2 General statistics terms Odds. Proportion. Percentage. Ratio. 19.3.3 Measures of occurence Incident. A single occurrence of an outcome of interest. We might also talk about the number of incident cases. Incidence.
