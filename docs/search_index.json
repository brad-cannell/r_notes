["index.html", "R Notes Welcome", " R Notes Brad Cannell 2021-06-27 Welcome Welcome to Brad Cannell’s R Notes! This repository is for a Bookdown version Brad Cannell’s R Notes. I’m really making this repository for me, but even better if you find it useful too! Why am I doing this (as opposed to just keeping notes locally)? Better organized (e.g., chapter structure and search) Easy access – just click on the bookmark on web browser Practice using bookdown Might help with R4Epi – This can be sort of a sandbox for developing before I add things to R4Epi.

Add a NOTES file and add it to .gitignore and .Rbuildignore using usethis: usethis::use_build_ignore(\"NOTES\") usethis::use_git_ignore(\"NOTES\") Delete all Rmd files except index.Rmd Create a folder named chapters.

Type “usethis::use_git(message =”Initial commit“)” in the R console. 1.3 Create a github repository for the book Go to: https://github.com/orgs/brad-cannell/dashboard Click New Name the repository. For example, “r_notes” Optionally, type in a description. For example, “This is the repository for my R notes bookdown project.” Make the repository public Don’t check the boxes for README, .gitignore, or license Click create repository Follow GitHub’s instructions for pushing the repository to GitHub. At this point, the GitHub repository should be set up. 1.4 Configuring a publishing source for the GitHub Pages site Useful websites: * https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/github.html * https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site In the repository, click on Settings, then pages (on the left sidebar). Change the source to Branch:master, folder = docs 1.5 Modify _bookdown.yml Start with this example and modify as needed book_filename: &quot;R 4 Epidemiology&quot; repo: https://github.com/brad-cannell/r4epi output_dir: docs delete_merged_file: true language: ui: chapter_name: &quot;&quot; new_session: no rmd_subdir: [&quot;chapters&quot;] 1.6 Modify _output.yml Start with this example and modify as needed bookdown::gitbook: css: style.css config: toc: collapse: section scroll_highlight: yes before: | &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;./&quot;&gt;R for Epidemiology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; after: | &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;Published with bookdown&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; 1.7 Modify style.css /****************************************************************************** CSS for the R4Epi textbook ******************************************************************************/ /* CSS that came with bookdown */ p.caption { color: #777; margin-top: 10px; } p code { white-space: inherit; } pre { word-break: normal; word-wrap: normal; } pre code { white-space: inherit; } /* Font Styles */ .large-bold { font-size: 2em; font-weight: bold; } .underline { text-decoration: underline; } .red-text { color: red; } .code { color: #0365C0; font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;, Courier, monospace; } /* Note styles */ .note { -moz-border-radius: 6px; -webkit-border-radius: 6px; background-color: #f0f7fb; border: solid 1px #3498db; border-radius: 6px; line-height: 18px; overflow: hidden; padding: 15px 15px; } .warning { -moz-border-radius: 6px; -webkit-border-radius: 6px; background-color: #FEFBEA; border: solid 1px #F2E394; border-radius: 6px; line-height: 18px; overflow: hidden; padding: 15px 15px; } 1.8 Modify index.Rmd Delete all the example text. Modify the YAML header. Here is an example: --- title: &quot;R for Epidemiology&quot; author: &quot;Brad Cannell&quot; date: &quot;2021-06-27&quot; site: bookdown::bookdown_site documentclass: book bibliography: [book.bib, packages.bib] link-citations: yes csl: ama.csl github-repo: brad-cannell/r4epi url: &#39;https://brad-cannell.github.io/r4epi/&#39; description: &quot;This is the textbook for Brad Cannell&#39;s Introduction to R Programming for Epidemiologic Research course.&quot; --- The csl: ama.csl part of the YAML header allows you to change the bibliography style. You can find a list of styles here: https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles For AMA, which I frequently want, you can just copy and paste from your templates folder. First-level headers become chapters. Use {-} at the end of the header if you don’t want the chapter to be numbered. For example # Welcome {-} 1.9 Creating bookdown chapters Each Rmd file is a chapter. Chapters can be broken up into parts. To do so, create a subdirectory for each part inside the chapters folder. The individual Rmd files (i.e. chapters) go inside these folders. I typically prefix each folder name that aligns with the order the parts should appear in. For example 01_getting_started, 02_best_practices, etc. The first Rmd file in each part folder should have only this content: # (PART) Getting Started {-} &lt;!-- This Rmd just creates a part heading in the table of contents --&gt; Name the file 00_part_&lt;part_name&gt; 1.10 Knitting the book Click on the build tab, then click “Build Book.” Commit the changes and push to GitHub. After a few minutes, you should see the GitHub pages version working. 1.11 Errors and warnings Output created: docs/index.html Warning message: In split_chapters(output, gitbook_page, number_sections, split_by, : You have 3 Rmd input file(s) but only 2 first-level heading(s).
