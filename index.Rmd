# Welcome {-}

Welcome to Brad Cannell's R Notes!

This is a [Bookdown](https://bookdown.org/) version Brad Cannell's R Notes. I'm really making this "book" for me, but even better if you find it useful too!

Why am I doing this (as opposed to just keeping notes locally)?     

* Better organized (e.g., chapter structure and search)      
* Easy access -- just click on the bookmark on web browser      
* Practice using bookdown      
* Might help with R4Epi -- This can be sort of a sandbox for developing before I add things to R4Epi.

## Organization {-}

These notes are loosely organized into the following parts:   

1. **Programming:** Things that have to do with optimizing code, writing functions, creating packages, and repeated operations.   

2. **Working with external files:** Things like data transfer, web scraping, PDF scraping, and using Officer to scrape Microsoft Office documents.   

3. **Data management:** Things related to manipulating/transforming/filtering data that is already in R.   

4. **Data analysis:** Things related to creating numerical summaries of data.

5. **Data visualization:** Things related to graphical summaries of data. A lot of this will be about ggplot. 

6. **Presenting results:**  Things related to making numerical and graphical summaries accessible outside of R. This can include webpages, static dashboards, PDF documents, Microsoft Office documents, ect. This does not include Shiny apps.  

7. **Shiny:** Things related to using Shiny to create interactive web apps. Eventually, this may need its own Bookdown project.
